</ul>
<p>Anki ist ein Programm, dass es einfach macht, sich Dinge zu merken.
Weil es viel effizienter ist als traditionelle Lernmethoden, kannst du entweder deine Lernzeit
drastisch reduzieren oder die Menge, die du lernst, enorm steigern.</p>
<p>Jeder, der sich in seinem Alltag Dinge merken muss, kann von Anki profitieren.
Da es inhaltsunabhängig ist und Bilder, Ton, Video und wissenschaftliche Textauszeichnung (durch
LaTeX) unterstützt, sind die Möglichkeiten unbegrenzt.
Hier sind ein paar Beispiele, was du mit Anki machen kannst:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eine Sprache lernen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>für eine Medizin- oder Jura-Prüfung lernen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Namen und Gesichter auswendig lernen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deine Geographiekenntnisse auffrischen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lange Gedichte meistern</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sogar Gitarrenakkorde üben!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hinter Anki stehen zwei simple Konzepte: <strong>active recall testing</strong> (aktive Erinnerungsprüfung) und
<strong>spaced repetition</strong> (verteilte Wiederholung). Den meisten Lernern sind sie unbekannt, obwohl über
sie seit Jahren in der wissenschaftlichen Literatur berichtet wird.
Zu verstehen, wie sie funktionieren, wird dich effektiver lernen lassen.</p>
<h2 id="active-recall-testing"><a class="header" href="#active-recall-testing"><em>Active recall testing</em></a></h2>
<p><em>Active recall testing</em> bedeutet, eine Frage gestellt zu bekommen und zu versuchen, sich an die
Antwort zu erinnern, mit anderen Worten, abgefragt zu werden.
Das Gegenstück dazu ist <strong>passives Lernen</strong>, bei dem wir etwas lesen, sehen oder hören, ohne dabei
innezuhalten, um zu überlegen, ob wir die Antwort kennen. Die Forschung hat gezeigt, dass Abfragen
wesentlich effektiver dazu ist, starke Erinnerungen zu formen, als passives Lernen. 
Dafür gibt es zwei Gründe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Das Abrufen einer Erinnerung <em>stärkt</em> sie und erhöht damit die Chance, sie
erneut abrufen zu können.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Können wir eine Frage nicht beantworten, sagt uns das, dass wir den Stoff
wiederholen oder neu erlernen müssen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wahrscheinlich kennst du <em>active recall testing</em> aus deiner Schulzeit, ohne dass
es dir bewusst ist. Wenn ein guter Lehrer dich nach der Lektüre eines Artikels
eine Reihe von Fragen beantworten oder wöchentliche Tests schreiben lässt,
macht er das nicht nur, um zu prüfen, ob du den Stoff verstanden hast.
Durch das Abfragen erhöht er auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass du dich in Zukunft
daran erinnern können wirst. </p>
<p>Eine gute Möglichkeit, <em>active recall testing</em> in deinen eigenen Lernprozess zu
integrieren, sind Karteikarten. Bei traditionellen Karteikarten aus Papier schreibst
du eine Frage auf die eine und die Antwort auf die andere Seite. 
Indem du die Karte nicht umdrehst, bis du über die Antwort nachgedacht hast,
kannst effektiver lernen, als durch passives Lernen möglich wäre.</p>
<h2 id="use-it-or-lose-it"><a class="header" href="#use-it-or-lose-it"><em>Use it or lose it</em></a></h2>
<p>Unser Gehirn ist eine effiziente Maschine, das Informationen, die nicht nützlich
erscheinen, schnell entsorgt. Vermutlich erinnerst du dich nicht daran, was du
am Montag vor zwei Wochen zum Abendessen hattest, weil diese Information für
gewöhnlich keinen Nutzen bringt.
Wenn du an dem Tag allerdings in einem großartigen Restaurant warst und die letzten
zwei Wochen jedem erzählt hast, wie toll es war, kannst du dich wahrscheinlich
noch lebhaft daran erinnern.</p>
<p>Das Gehirn wendet das Prinzip <em>&quot;use it or lose it&quot;</em> (&quot;benutz es oder verlier es&quot;)
auf alles an, was wir lernen. Wenn du einen Nachmittag lang Fachausdrücke auswendig
gelernt und dann zwei Wochen nicht daran gedacht hast, hast du vermutlich die
meisten wieder vergessen. Tatsächlich haben Studien gezeigt, dass wir etwa 75%
des gelernten Stoffes innerhalb von 48 Stunden vergessen. Das mag ziemlich
deprimierend erscheinen, wenn du du sehr viel lernen musst!</p>
<p>Die Lösung ist jedoch einfach: <em>Wiederholung</em>. Durch das Wiederholen neu erlernter
Informationen, können wir dem Vergessen stark entgegenwirken.</p>
<p>Das einzige Problem ist, dass Wiederholung traditioneller Weise nicht sehr
praktikabel ist. Benutzt du Karteikarten aus Papier, kannst du sie schnell
durchblättern, wenn du nur 30 von ihnen wiederholen musst. Aber wenn es 300
oder 3000 sind, wird die Handhabung schnell schwierig.</p>
<h2 id="spaced-repetition"><a class="header" href="#spaced-repetition"><em>Spaced Repetition</em></a></h2>
<p>Über den Abstandseffekt berichtete 1885 der deutsche Psychologe Hermann Ebbinghaus.
Er beobachtete, dass wir uns besser an Dinge erinnern können, wenn die Wiederholungen
über einen gewissen Zeitraum verteilt, anstatt alle in einer einzigen Sitzung
erfolgt sind. Seit den 1930ern wurde eine Reihe von Vorschlägen gemacht, wie dieser
Effekt zur Verbesserung des Lernprozesses genutzt werden kann, und es etablierte
sich der Begriff <em>spaced repetition</em>.</p>
<p>Ein Beispiel dafür ist die <em>Spaced-Repetition</em>-Methode mittels Karteikarten aus Papier,
die der deutsche Publizist Sebastian Leitner 1972 bekannt machte. Indem die Karten
in eine Reihe von Kästen eingeordnet und je nach erfolgreicher oder gescheiterter
Wiederholung einem neuen Kasten zugeordnet wurden, war es möglich, mit einem Blick
einen groben Überblick davon zu bekommen, wie gut eine Karte bekannt war und wann
die nächste Wiederholung erfolgen sollte. Das war eine deutliche Verbesserung
zu nur einem einzelnen Kasten und wurde weitgehend in Karteikarten-Software
umgesetzt.
Es ist allerdings ein eher ungenaues Vorgehen, da es kein exaktes Datum liefert,
zu dem Stoff wiederholt werden sollte, und nicht gut mit Stoff unterschiedlicher
Schwierigkeit zurechtkommt.</p>
<p>Die größten Entwicklungen in den letzten 30 Jahren stammen von den Urhebern von
SuperMemo, einem kommerziellen Karteikartenprogramm, das <em>spaced repetition</em>
benutzt. SuperMemo bereitete den Weg für ein System, das den optimalen Zeitpunkt
für die Wiederholung des Lernstoffs überwacht und sich selbst basierend auf der
Leistung des Anwenders optimiert.</p>
<p>In SuperMemos System teilst du dem Programm bei jedem Beantworten einer Frage mit,
wie gut du dich erinnern konntest — ob du die Antwort komplett vergessen hattest,
einen kleinen Fehler gemacht hast, Schwierigkeiten hattest, dich zu erinnern,
dich leicht erinnern konntest, etc. Das Programm nutzt diese Rückmeldung, um den
perfekten Zeitpunkt zu bestimmen, dir die Frage erneut zu zeigen.
Weil die Erinnerung durch jeden erfolgreichen Abruf stärker wird, wird die Zeit

das erste Mal, dann 3 Tage später, 15 Tage später, 45 Tage später und so weiter.</p>
<p>Das war eine Revolution des Lernens, da es bedeutete, dass Stoff mit dem absoluten
Minimum an Aufwand gelernt und behalten werden konnte.
SuperMemos Slogan fasst es zusammen: Mit <em>spaced repetition</em> kannst du Vergessen
vergessen.</p>
<h2 id="warum-anki"><a class="header" href="#warum-anki">Warum Anki?</a></h2>
<p>Obwohl SuperMemos enormer Einfluss auf das Gebiet nicht zu leugnen ist, hat es auch
seine Probleme. Das Programm wird oft als fehlerhaft und schwer navigierbar
kritisert. Es läuft nur auf Windows. Es is geschützte Software, das heißt Endbenutzer
können sie nicht erweitern oder auf die Rohdaten zugreifen. Und während sehr alte
Versionen kostenlos zur Vefügung gestellt wurden, sind sie für die heutige Nutzung
ziemlich limitiert.</p>
<p>Anki behebt diese Probleme. Es gibt kostenlose Versionen für viele Plattformen,
sodass Schüler und Lehrer mit begrenztem Budget nicht außen vor sind.
Anki ist quelloffene Software mit einer florierenden Sammlung von Erweiterungen,
die von Endbenutzern beigesteuert wurden.
Es läuft auf vielen Plattformen, Windows, macOS, Linux/FreeBSD und einigen Mobilgeräten.
Und es ist wesentlich einfacher zu benutzen als SuperMemo.</p>
<p>Ankis <em>Spaced-Repetition</em>-System basiert auf einem älteren, <a href="faqs.html">SM-2</a>
genannten Algorithmus von SuperMemo.</p>

<p>Neue Anki-Versionen benötigen die 64-Bit-Version von Windows 7, 8, 10 oder 11.</p>
<p>Die letzte Version, die 32-Bit-Windows unterstützt, war <em>Anki 2.1.35-alternate</em>.
Wenn du einen alten PC hast, kannst du diese Version

<p>Wenn du die Meldung <em>&quot;LoadLibrary ist mit Fehler 126 fehlgeschlagen&quot;</em> bekommst,
könnte das daran liegen, dass das von Anki benutzte Toolkit Probleme mit
<a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/error-126-on-open-anki-desktop/13967">mehreren Bildschirmen</a>
hat.</p>
<h2 id="antivirus---firewall-software"><a class="header" href="#antivirus---firewall-software">Antivirus- / Firewall-Software</a></h2>
<p>Drittanbieter-Software auf deinem Rechner kann Anki am Starten hindern. Du kannst
versuchen, eine Ausnahme hinzuzufügen oder die Antivirus- / Firewall-Software
vorübergehend deaktivieren, um zu sehen, ob es hilft.</p>
<h2 id="administratorrechte"><a class="header" href="#administratorrechte">Administratorrechte</a></h2>
<p>Einige Nutzer haben berichtet, dass Anki erst gestartet hat, nachdem sie auf das
Anki-Symbol rechtsgeklickt und &quot;Als Administrator ausführen&quot; ausgewählt haben.
Anki speichert all seine Dateien in deinem Benutzerorder und sollte keine Administratorrechte
benötigen, aber es ist einen Versuch wert, wenn du die Alternativen ausgeschöpft hast.</p>
<h2 id="mehrere-anki-installationen-nach-update"><a class="header" href="#mehrere-anki-installationen-nach-update">Mehrere Anki-Installationen nach Update</a></h2>
<p>Wenn nach einem Update mehrere Anki-Installationen vorliegen (zum Beispiel in
<code>C:\Programme\Anki</code> and <code>C:\Programme (x86)\Anki</code>), könnten sie fehlerhaft
sein und Anki sich nicht ohne Fehlermeldung starten lassen.</p>
<p>Versuche, alle Kopien zu deinstallieren, zum Beispiel mit Windows' <code>Apps und Features</code>
oder, indem du <code>uninstall.exe</code> in jedem Anki-Ordner ausführst. Anschließend kannst
du Anki wieder installieren.</p>
<h2 id="debuggen"><a class="header" href="#debuggen">Debuggen</a></h2>
<p>Anki von der Konsole aus zu starten, kann weitere Erkenntnisse über einige Fehler
liefern. Nachdem du die neueste Anki-Version und alle Windows-Updates installiert
hast, kannst du Start&gt;Ausführen&gt;cmd.exe benutzen, anstatt Anki direkt zu starten.
Gib Folgendes in die geöffnete Konsole ein:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bat">cd \program files\anki &amp; anki-console
</code></pre>
<p>Vermutlich wird Anki genausowenig starten wie zuvor, aber es könnte Informationen
über die Fehlerursache liefern.</p>
<h2 id="wenn-alles-andere-versagt"><a class="header" href="#wenn-alles-andere-versagt">Wenn alles andere versagt</a></h2>
<p>Wenn du Anki immer noch nicht starten kannst, nachdem du alle obigen Vorschläge
ausprobiert hast, gibt es noch zwei verbleibende Optionen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Du kannst versuchen,
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/running-from-python.html">Anki von Python aus</a> zu starten.</li>
<li>Du kannst eine ältere Anki-Version wie 2.1.35-alternate oder 2.1.15 ausprobieren,
die mit einer anderen Version des Toolkits erstellt wurden.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="anzeigeprobleme"><a class="header" href="#anzeigeprobleme">Anzeigeprobleme</a></h1>
<p>Auf Windows gibt es drei Möglichkeiten, Inhalte auf dem Bildschirm anzuzeigen.
Der Standard ist <em>Software</em>, langsam aber am kompatibelsten. Es gibt zwei
Alternativen: <em>OpenGL</em> und <em>ANGLE</em>. Sie sind schneller, aber funktionieren vielleicht
nicht oder nicht richtig, was zu fehlenden Menüleisten, leeren Fenstern und so weiter
führen kann. Welche Option am besten funktioniert, hängt von deinem Computer ab.</p>
<p>Der Anzeigetreiber kann unter Werkzeuge&gt;Einstellungen angepasst werden.
Anschließend solltest du Anki neu starten.</p>
<p>Wenn du nicht auf Ankis Einstellungen zugreifen kannst und Anki ein paar mal neu zu
starten nicht hilft, musst du den Grafiktreiber vielleicht manuell anpassen.
Dafür kannst cmd.exe starten und das Folgende eingeben:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bat">echo auto &gt; %APPDATA%\Anki2\gldriver
</code></pre>
<p>Die Voreinstellung ist <code>software</code>; die beiden anderen Treiber, die du ausprobieren kannst,
sind <code>angle</code> und <code>auto</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="probleme-beim-kopieren-und-einfügen"><a class="header" href="#probleme-beim-kopieren-und-einfügen">Probleme beim Kopieren und Einfügen</a></h1>
<p>Wenn du Probleme beim Kopieren und Einfügen hast, überprüfe bitte, ob du andere
Programme auf dem PC laufen hast, die die Zwischenablage überwachen, zum Beispiel
Wörterbuchprogramme, Zwischenablage-Manager oder Ausschnittswerkzeuge.
Wenn solche Programme laufen, kann die Programmbibliothek, die Anki benutzt,
Schwierigkeiten bekommen.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="textgröße"><a class="header" href="#textgröße">Textgröße</a></h1>
<p>Wenn du feststellst, dass der Text die falsche Größe hat, gibt es zwei Umgebungsvariablen,
die du ausprobieren kannst:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ANKI_NOHIGHDPI=1</code> deaktiviert teilweise Qt’s Unterstützung für hohe DPI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ANKI_WEBSCALE=1</code> ändert die Skalierung von Ankis Web-Ansichten (wie die Stapelübersicht,
den Lernbildschirm etc.), wohingegen es Schnittstellen-Elemente wie die Menüleiste
nicht verändert. Ersetze <code>1</code> mit der gewünschten Skalierung, wie <code>1.5</code> oder <code>0.75</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Windows kannst du diese Variablen zu einer Batch-Datei hinzufügen, um Anki leichter
starten zu können. Erstelle zum Beispiel eine Datei <code>startanki.bat</code> auf deinem
Desktop mit folgendem Inhalt:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bat">set ANKI_WEBSCALE=0.75
start &quot;Anki&quot; &quot;C:\Programme\Anki\anki&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Nach dem Speichern kannst du die Datei doppelklicken, um Anki mit dieser Einstellung
zu starten.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="berechtigungsprobleme"><a class="header" href="#berechtigungsprobleme">Berechtigungsprobleme</a></h1>
<p>Wenn du Fehlermeldungen wie &quot;Zugriff verweigert&quot; erhältst, sind einige Anki-Dateien
vielleicht schreibgeschützt, das heißt, Anki kann sie nicht verändern.</p>
<p>Um das Problem zu beheben, kannst du das Folgende tun:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gib <code>cmd.exe</code> in die Suchleiste des Startmenüs ein und drücke <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
<li>Gib <code>whoami</code> in das sich öffnende Fenster ein und drücke <kbd>Enter</kbd>,
um deinen Benutzernamen anzuzeigen.</li>
<li>Gib nun das Folgende ein, wobei du nach jeder Zeile <kbd>Enter</kbd> drückst und
____ (ohne das <code>:F</code> zu entfernen) mit deinem Benutzernamen ersetzt:
<pre><code class="language-bat">cd %APPDATA%
icacls Anki2 /grant ____:F /t
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dieser Befehl sollte die Zugriffsrechte in Ankis Dateiordner korrigieren und du
solltest nun in der Lage sein, das Programm zu starten.</p>
<h2 id="antivirus--firewall--anti-malware"><a class="header" href="#antivirus--firewall--anti-malware">Antivirus / Firewall / Anti-Malware</a></h2>
<p>Einige Nutzer haben Fehlermeldungen wie &quot;Zugriff verweigert&quot; oder &quot;schreibgeschützt&quot;
erhalten, die von Sicherheits-Software verursacht wurden. Möglicherweise musst du
eine Ausnahme für Anki hinzufügen oder die Software vorübergehend deaktivieren,
um sie als Verursacher ausschließen zu können.
Manche Nutzer haben berichtet, dass allein, die Software abzuschalten, nicht geholfen
hat und sie entweder eine Ausnahme für Anki hinzufügen oder die Software deinstallieren mussten.</p>
<h2 id="berechtigungsprobleme-finden-und-beseitigen"><a class="header" href="#berechtigungsprobleme-finden-und-beseitigen">Berechtigungsprobleme finden und beseitigen</a></h2>
<p>Wenn die Probleme weiterhin bestehen, nachdem du Antivirus- und ähnliche Programme
ausgeschlossen hast, die oben beschriebenen Schritte ausgeführt hast und nicht OneDrive
benutzt, führe bitte die folgenden Befehle in <code>cmd.exe</code> aus, indem du nach jeder Zeile
<kbd>Enter</kbd> drückst:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bat">whoami
cd %APPDATA%
icacls Anki2 /t
</code></pre>
<p>Mache anschließend einen Screenshot von dem, was du siehst, oder kopiere es, und
schick es uns in einer Support-Anfrage.</p>

<p>We have seen a lot of issues caused by the customized versions of Anki
distributed by Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anki depends on third-party libraries like Qt, and Linux distributions often
substitute different versions of those libraries, without testing the impact
of those changes.</li>
<li>Sometimes the version of Anki they distribute is years old, or is an
alpha/beta version not intended for stable release. Distributions will often
disable the built-in update check as well, to prevent you from being notified
of newer versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compiled builds of Anki are available on <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">https://apps.ankiweb.net</a>. Most of the
necessary libraries are included, and Anki has been tested to work with these
library versions. If you're experiencing issues with your distro's version, the
first thing you should try is switching to the latest packaged version we
provide.</p>
<p>You are welcome to continue using your distro's version of Anki if you prefer,
but if you run into any issues, you will need to report them to your
distribution's package maintainers.</p>

<p>You can work around this issue by explicitly telling Anki what the GTK theme is. Run the following commands in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">theme=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme)
echo &quot;gtk-theme-name=$theme&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.gtkrc-2.0
echo &quot;export GTK2_RC_FILES=$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.profile

<h2 id="key-concepts"><a class="header" href="#key-concepts">Key Concepts</a></h2>
<h3 id="cards"><a class="header" href="#cards">Cards</a></h3>
<p>A question and answer pair is called a 'card'. This is based on a paper
flashcard with a question on one side and the answer on the back. In
Anki a card doesn’t actually look like a physical card, and when you
show the answer the question remains visible by default. For example, if
you’re studying basic chemistry, you might see a question like:</p>
<pre><code>Q: Chemical symbol for oxygen?
</code></pre>
<p>After thinking about it, and deciding the answer is O, you click the
show answer button, and Anki shows you:</p>
<pre><code>Q: Chemical symbol for oxygen?
A: O
</code></pre>
<p>After confirming that you are correct, you can tell Anki how well you
remembered, and Anki will choose a next time to show you again.</p>
<h3 id="decks"><a class="header" href="#decks">Decks</a></h3>
<p>A 'deck' is a group of cards. You can place cards in different decks to
study parts of your card collection instead of studying everything at
once. Each deck can have different settings, such as how many new cards
to show each day, or how long to wait until cards are shown again.</p>
<p>Decks can contain other decks, which allows you to organize decks into a
tree. Anki uses “::” to show different levels. A deck called
“Chinese::Hanzi” refers to a “Hanzi” deck, which is part of a “Chinese”
deck. If you select “Hanzi” then only the Hanzi cards will be shown; if
you select “Chinese” then all Chinese cards, including Hanzi cards, will
be shown.</p>
<p>To place decks into a tree, you can either name them with “::” between
each level, or drag and drop them from the deck list. Decks that have
been nested under another deck (that is, that have at least one “::” in
their names) are often called 'subdecks', and top-level decks are
sometimes called 'superdecks' or 'parent decks'.</p>
<p>Anki starts with a deck called “default”; any cards which have somehow
become separated from other decks will go here. Anki will hide the
default deck if it contains no cards and you have added other decks.
Alternatively, you may rename this deck and use it for other cards.</p>
<p>Decks are best used to hold broad categories of cards, rather than
specific topics such as “food verbs” or “lesson 1”. For more info on
this, please see the <a href="editing.html#using-decks-appropriately">using decks appropriately</a> section.</p>
<p>For information on how decks affect the order cards are displayed in,
please see the <a href="studying.html#display-order">display order</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="notes--fields"><a class="header" href="#notes--fields">Notes &amp; Fields</a></h3>
<p>When making flashcards, it’s often desirable to make more than one card
that relates to some information. For example, if you’re learning
French, and you learn that the word “bonjour” means “hello”, you may
wish to create one card that shows you “bonjour” and asks you to
remember “hello”, and another card that shows you “hello” and asks you
to remember “bonjour”. One card is testing your ability to recognize the
foreign word, and the other card is testing your ability to produce it.</p>
<p>When using paper flashcards, your only option in this case is to write
out the information twice, once for each card. Some computer flashcard
programs make life easier by providing a feature to flip the front and
back sides. This is an improvement over the paper situation, but there
are two major downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because such programs don’t track your performance of recognition
and production separately, cards will tend not to be shown to you at
the optimum time, meaning you forget more than you’d like, or you
study more than is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reversing the question and answer only works when you want exactly
the same content on each side. This means it’s not possible to
display extra info on the back of each card for example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anki solves these problems by allowing you to split the content of your
cards up into separate pieces of information. You can then tell Anki
which pieces of information you want on each card, and Anki will take
care of creating the cards for you and updating them if you make any
edits in the future.</p>
<p>Imagine we want to study French vocabulary, and we want to include the
page number on the back of each card. We want our cards to look like
this:</p>
<pre><code>Q: Bonjour
A: Hello
   Page #12
</code></pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>Q: Hello
A: Bonjour
   Page #12
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have three pieces of related information: a French
word, an English meaning, and a page number. If we put them together,
they’d look like this:</p>
<pre><code>French: Bonjour
English: Hello
Page: 12
</code></pre>
<p>In Anki, this related information is called a 'note', and each piece of
information is called a 'field'. So we can say that this type of note
has three fields: French, English, and Page.</p>
<p>To add and edit fields, click the “Fields…​” button while adding or
editing notes. For more information on fields, please see the
<a href="editing.html#customizing-fields">Customizing Fields</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="card-types"><a class="header" href="#card-types">Card Types</a></h3>
<p>In order for Anki to create cards based on our notes, we need to give it
a blueprint that says which fields should be displayed on the front or
back of each card. This blueprint is called a 'card type'. Each type of
note can have one or more card types; when you add a note, Anki will
create one card for each card type.</p>
<p>Each card type has two 'templates', one for the question and one for the
answer. In the above French example, we wanted the recognition card to
look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Q: Bonjour
A: Hello
   Page #12
</code></pre>
<p>To do this, we can set the question and answer templates to:</p>
<pre><code>Q: {{French}}
A: {{English}}&lt;br&gt;
   Page #{{Page}}
</code></pre>
<p>By surrounding a field name in double curly brackets, we tell Anki to
replace that section with the actual information in the field. Anything
not surrounded by curly brackets remains the same on each card. (For
instance, we don’t have to type “Page #” into the Page field when
adding material – it’s added automatically to every card.) &lt;br&gt; is
a special code that tells Anki to move to the next line; more details
are available in the <a href="templates/intro.html">templates</a> section.</p>
<p>The production card templates work in a similar way:</p>
<pre><code>Q: {{English}}
A: {{French}}&lt;br&gt;
   Page #{{Page}}
</code></pre>
<p>Once a card type has been created, every time you add a new note, a card
will be created based on that card type. Card types make it easy to keep
the formatting of your cards consistent and can greatly reduce the
amount of effort involved in adding information. They also mean Anki can
ensure related cards don’t appear too close to each other, and they
allow you to fix a typing mistake or factual error once and have all the
related cards updated at once.</p>
<p>To add and edit card types, click the “Cards…​” button while adding or
editing notes. For more information on card types, please see the <a href="templates/intro.html">Cards
and Templates</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="note-types"><a class="header" href="#note-types">Note Types</a></h3>
<p>Anki allows you to create different types of notes for different
material. Each type of note has its own set of fields and card types.
It’s a good idea to create a separate note type for each broad topic
you’re studying. In the above French example, we might create a note
type called “French” for that. If we wanted to learn capital cities, we
could create a separate note type for that as well, with fields such as
“Country” and “Capital City”.</p>
<p>When Anki checks for duplicates, it only compares other notes of the
same type. Thus if you add a capital city called “Orange” using the
capital city note type, you won’t see a duplicate message when it comes
time to learn how to say “orange” in French.</p>
<p>When you create a new collection, Anki automatically adds some standard
note types to it. These note types are provided to make Anki easier for
new users, but in the long run it’s recommended you define your own note
types for the content you are learning. The standard note types are as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>Basic</strong> 
Has Front and Back fields, and will create one card. Text you enter in
Front will appear on the front of the card, and text you enter in Back
will appear on the back of the card.</p>
<p><strong>Basic (and reversed card)</strong><br />
Like Basic, but creates two cards for the text you enter: one from
front→back and one from back→front.</p>
<p><strong>Basic (optional reversed card)</strong> 
This is a front→back card, and optionally a back→front card. To do this,
it has a third field called “Add Reverse.” If you enter any text into
that field, a reverse card will be created. More information about this
is available in the <a href="templates/intro.html">Cards and Templates</a> section.</p>
<p><strong>Cloze</strong><br />
A note type which makes it easy to select text and turn it into a cloze
deletion (e.g., “Man landed on the moon in […​]” → “Man landed on the
moon in 1969”). More information is available in the <a href="editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze
deletion</a> section.</p>
<p>To add your own note types and modify existing ones, you can use Tools →
Manage Note Types from the main Anki window.</p>
<p>Notes and note types are common to your whole collection rather than
limited to an individual deck. This means you can use many different
types of notes in a particular deck, or have different cards generated
from a particular note in different decks. When you add notes using the
Add window, you can select what note type to use and what deck to use,
and these choices are completely independent of each other. You can also
change the note type of some notes <a href="browsing.html">after you’ve already created
them</a>.</p>
<h3 id="collection"><a class="header" href="#collection">Collection</a></h3>
<p>Your 'collection' is all the material stored in Anki – your cards,
notes, decks, note types, deck options, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="shared-decks"><a class="header" href="#shared-decks">Shared Decks</a></h2>
<p>You can watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS2G-k2hQyg&amp;yt:cc=on">a video about Shared Decks and Review
Basics</a> on YouTube.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with Anki is to download a deck of cards
someone has shared:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the “Get Shared” button at the bottom of the deck list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you’ve found a deck you’re interested in, click the “Download”
button to download a deck package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double-click on the downloaded package to load it into Anki, or
File→Import it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that it’s not currently possible to add shared decks
directly to your AnkiWeb account. You need to import them with the
desktop program, then synchronize to upload them to AnkiWeb.</p>
<p>Creating your own deck is the most effective way to learn a complex
subject. Subjects like languages and the sciences can’t be understood
simply by memorizing facts — they require explanation and context to
learn effectively. Furthermore, inputting the information yourself
forces you to decide what the key points are, leading to a better
understanding.</p>
<p>If you are a language learner, you may be tempted to download a long
list of words and their translations, but this won’t teach you a
language any more than memorizing scientific equations will teach you
astrophysics. To learn properly, you need textbooks, teachers, or
exposure to real-world sentences.</p>
<pre><code>Do not learn if you do not understand.
--SuperMemo
</code></pre>
<p>Most shared decks are created by people who are learning material
outside of Anki – from textbooks, classes, TV, etc. They select the
interesting points from what they learn and put them into Anki. They
make no effort to add background information or explanations to the
cards, because they already understand the material. So when someone
else downloads their deck and tries to use it, they’ll find it very
difficult as the background information and explanations are missing.</p>
<p>That is not to say shared decks are useless – simply that for complex
subjects, they should be used as a 'supplement' to external material,
not as a 'replacement' for it. If you’re studying textbook ABC and
someone has shared a deck of ideas from ABC, that’s a great way to save
some time. And for simple subjects that are basically a list of facts,
such as capital city names or pub quiz trivia, you probably don’t need
external material. But if you attempt to study complex subjects without
external material, you will probably meet with disappointing results.</p>

<p>When you have found a deck you like or entered some notes in, it’s time
to start studying.</p>
<h2 id="decks-1"><a class="header" href="#decks-1">Decks</a></h2>
<p>Study in Anki is limited to the currently selected deck as well as any
subdecks it contains.</p>
<p>On the decks screen, your decks will be displayed in a list. There are
three columns. 'New' is the number of new
cards that are ready to be learnt that day. The second column shows
the number of cards currently in learning. 'Due' is the count of waiting
reviews. </p>
<p>When you click on a deck, it will become the 'current deck', and Anki
will change to the study screen. You can return to the deck list to
change the currently selected deck at any time by clicking on “Decks” at
the top of the main window. (You can also use the Study
Deck action in the menu to select a new deck from the keyboard, or you
can press the <kbd>s</kbd> key to study the currently selected deck.)</p>
<p>You can click the gears button to the right of a deck to rename or
delete a deck, change its <a href="deck-options.html">options</a>, or <a href="exporting.html">export</a> it.</p>
<h2 id="study-overview"><a class="header" href="#study-overview">Study Overview</a></h2>
<p>After clicking on a deck to study, you’ll see a screen that shows you
how many cards are due today. This is called the 'deck overview' screen.
The cards are split into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>New</strong> refers to cards that you have downloaded or entered in, but
have never been studied before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning</strong> refers to cards that were seen for the first time
recently, and are still being learnt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To Review</strong> refers to cards that were previously learnt, and now
need to be reviewed so you don’t forget them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To start a study session, click the <strong>Study Now</strong> button. Anki will
proceed to show you cards until the cards to be shown for the day have
run out.</p>
<p>While studying, you can return to the overview by pressing the <kbd>s</kbd> key
on your keyboard.</p>
<h2 id="questions"><a class="header" href="#questions">Questions</a></h2>
<p>When a card is shown, only the question is shown at first. After
thinking about the answer, either click the <strong>Show Answer</strong> button, or
press the spacebar. The answer will then be shown. It’s okay if it takes
you a little while to recall the answer, but as a general rule if you
can’t answer within about 10 seconds, it’s probably better to give up
and show the answer than keep struggling to remember.</p>
<p>When the answer is shown, you should compare the answer you thought of
with the answer which is shown and tell Anki how well you remembered. If
you don’t trust yourself to compare your answer accurately, you can ask
Anki to <a href="templates/fields.html#checking-your-answer">prompt you to type in the answer</a> rather than
just showing it to you.</p>
<h2 id="learningrelearning-cards"><a class="header" href="#learningrelearning-cards">Learning/Relearning Cards</a></h2>
<p>When learning new cards, or when relearning cards that you have
forgotten, Anki will show you the cards one or more times to help you
memorize them. Each time is called a 'learning step'. By default there
are two steps: 1 minute and 10 minutes. You can change the number of
steps and the delays between them in the <a href="deck-options.html#new-cards">deck options</a>.</p>
<p>There are four rating buttons when learning:</p>
<p><strong>Again</strong> moves the card back to the first step.</p>
<p><strong>Hard</strong>  repeats the current step after the first step, and is the average 
of Again and Good on the first step.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> moves the card to the <a href="deck-options.html#learning-steps">next step</a>. If the card was on the final
step, the card is converted into a review card (it 'graduates'). By
default, once the card has reached the end of the learning steps, the
card will be shown again the next day, then at increasingly long delays
(see the next section).</p>
<p><strong>Easy</strong> immediately converts the card into a review card, even if there
were steps remaining. <a href="deck-options.html#easy-interval">By default</a>, the card will be shown again 4 days
later, and then at increasingly long delays. In the v1 scheduler, the &quot;Easy&quot; button will not be
shown if you are in relearning mode as it would give the same interval
as “Good.” With the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">v2 scheduler+</a>,
when cards are in relearning, the &quot;Easy&quot; button boosts the interval by 1 day.</p>
<p>When cards are seen for the first time, they start at step one. This
means answering <strong>Good</strong> on a card for the first time will show it one
more time in 10 minutes, and the initial 1 minute step will be skipped.
If you push Again, though, the card will come back in 1 minute.</p>
<p>You can use the <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> and <kbd>4</kbd> keys on your keyboard to select a particular
button, where <kbd>1</kbd> is <strong>Again</strong>. Pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> will select
<strong>Good</strong>.</p>
<p>If there are no other cards to show you, Anki will show learning cards
again even if their delay has not elapsed completely. If you’d prefer to
wait the full learning delay, you can change this behaviour in 
<a href="preferences.html">Preferences&gt;Scheduling&gt;Learn Ahead Limit</a>.</p>
<h2 id="review-cards"><a class="header" href="#review-cards">Review Cards</a></h2>
<p>When a card has been previously learnt and is ready to be reviewed
again, there are four buttons to rate your answer:</p>
<p><strong>Again</strong> marks your answer as incorrect and asks Anki to show the card
more frequently in the future. The card is said to have 'lapsed'. Please
see the <a href="deck-options.html#lapses">lapses</a> section for more information about how lapsed
reviews are handled.</p>
<p><strong>Hard</strong> by default, shows the card at a <a href="deck-options.html#hard-interval">slightly longer delay</a> 
than last time, and tells Anki to show the card more frequently in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> tells Anki that the last delay was about right, and the card
easiness doesn’t need to be adjusted down or up. At the <a href="deck-options.html#starting-ease">default starting
easiness</a>, the card will be shown again approximately 2 1/2 times longer
than the previous time, so if you had waited 10 days to see the card
previously, the next delay would be about 25 days.</p>
<p><strong>Easy</strong> tells Anki you found the delay too short. The card will be
scheduled <a href="deck-options.html#easy-bonus">further into the future than 'Good'</a>, and Anki will schedule
the card less frequently in the future. Because 'Easy' rapidly increases
the delay, it’s best used for only the easiest of cards. Usually you
should find yourself answering 'Good' instead.</p>
<p>As with learning cards, you can use <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> and <kbd>4</kbd> on the keyboard to select an
answer. Pressing the <kbd>spacebar</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> will select <strong>Good</strong>.</p>
<p>See <a href="deck-options.html">Deck Options</a> and the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm.html">FAQ</a>
to learn more about how the algorithm works. </p>
<h2 id="due-counts"><a class="header" href="#due-counts">Due Counts</a></h2>
<p>When only the question is shown, Anki shows three numbers like 12 + 34 +
56 at the bottom of the screen. These represent the new cards, cards in
learning, and cards to review. If you’d prefer not to see the numbers,
you can turn them off in Anki’s preferences.</p>
<p>In the v1 scheduler, the numbers count <em>reviews</em> needed to finish all the
cards in that queue, not the number of <em>cards</em>. If you have multiple
steps configured for lapsed cards, the number will increase by more than
one when you fail a card, since that card needs to be shown several times.</p>
<p>From the v2 scheduler, the numbers count <em>cards</em>, so the number will always
increase by one regardless of the steps remaining.</p>
<p>When the answer is shown, Anki shows an estimate of the next time a card
will be shown above each button. If you’d prefer not to see the
estimates, you can disable them in Anki’s <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fuzz-factor"><a class="header" href="#fuzz-factor">Fuzz Factor</a></h2>
<p>When you select an ease button on a review card, Anki also applies a small amount of random “fuzz”
to prevent cards that were introduced at the same time and given the same ratings
from sticking together and always coming up for review on the same day. This fuzz
will appear on the answer buttons when the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">v3 scheduler</a> is enabled, so if
you are using a previous version and you’re noticing a slight discrepancy between
what you select and the intervals your cards actually get, this is probably the
cause.</p>
<p>Learning cards are also given up to 5 minutes of extra delay so that they 
don’t always appear in the same order, but answer buttons won't reflect that. It 
is not possible to turn this feature off.</p>
<h2 id="editing-and-more"><a class="header" href="#editing-and-more">Editing and More</a></h2>
<p>You can click the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the bottom left to edit the current
note. When you finish editing, you’ll be returned to study. The editing
screen works very similarly to the <a href="editing.html">add notes</a> screen.</p>
<p>At the bottom right of the review screen is a button labeled <strong>More</strong>.
This button provides some other operations you can do on the current
card or note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="editing.html#using-flags"><strong>Flag Card</strong></a>: Adds a colored marker to the card, or toggles it off. Flags will appear during
study, and you can search for flagged cards in the Browse screen. This is useful
when you want to take some action on the card at a later date, such as looking
up a word when you get home. If you're using Anki 2.1.45+, you can also rename flags 
from the <a href="browsing.html">browser</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bury Card / Note</strong>: Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review until the next day.
(If you want to unbury cards before then, you can click the “unbury”
button on the <a href="studying.html#study-overview">deck overview</a> screen.) This is useful if
you cannot answer the card at the moment or you want to come back to it
another time. Burying can also <a href="studying.html#siblings-and-burying">happen automatically</a> for
cards of the same note.</p>
<p>With the old scheduler, if cards were in learning when they are buried,
they are moved back to the new card queue or review queue prior to being
buried.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">2.1 scheduler</a>,
however, burying cards does not reset a card's learning steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set Due Card</strong>: Make cards review cards, and <a href="browsing.html#cards">make them due on a certain date.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspend Card / Note</strong>: Hides a card or all of the note’s cards from review until they are
manually unsuspended (by clicking the suspend button in the browser).
This is useful if you want to avoid reviewing the note for some time,
but don’t want to delete it.
With the old scheduler, if cards were in learning when they are
suspended, they are moved back to the new card queue or review queue
prior to being suspended.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">2.1 scheduler</a>,
however, suspending cards does not reset a card's learning steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Options</strong>: Edit the <a href="deck-options.html">options</a> for the current deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Card Info</strong>: Displays <a href="stats.html#card-info">statistical information</a> about the card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="editing.html#the-marked-tag"><strong>Mark Note</strong></a>: Adds a “marked” tag to the current note, so it can be easily found in the
browser. This is similar to flagging individual cards, but works with a tag
instead, so if the note has multiple cards, all cards will appear in a search
for the marked tag. Most users will want to use flags instead. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delete Note</strong>: Deletes the note and all of its cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replay Audio</strong>: If the card has audio on the front or back, play it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pause Audio</strong>: Pauses the audio if it is playing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Audio -5s / +5s</strong>: Jump backwards / forward 5 seconds in the currently playing audio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Record Own Voice</strong>: Record from your microphone for the purposes of checking your
pronunciation. This recording is temporary and will go away when you
move to the next card. If you want to add audio to a card permanently,
you can do that in the edit window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replay Own Voice</strong>: Replay the previous recording of your voice (presumably after showing
the answer).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display-order"><a class="header" href="#display-order">Display Order</a></h2>
<p>Studying will show cards from the selected deck and any decks it
contains. Thus, if you select your “French” deck, the subdecks
“French::Vocab” and “French::My Textbook::Lesson 1” will be shown as
well.</p>
<p>The way Anki Anki fetches cards from the decks depends on the algorithm used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With the v1 scheduler, when a deck has subdecks, the cards will appear from <a href="studying.html#display-order">each deck in
turn</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">v2 scheduler</a>,
when a deck has subdecks, reviews are taken from all children decks
at once. The review limit of the child decks is ignored - only the limit of the
deck you clicked on applies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">v3 scheduler</a>
each child deck's limit is also enforced, and you do not need to see the cards 
in deck order either. See the <a href="deck-options.html#review-sort-order">deck options</a> section of the manual for more information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, for new cards, Anki fetches cards from the decks in
alphabetical order. So in the above example, you would get cards first
from “French”, then “My Textbook”, and finally “Vocab”. You can use this
to control the order cards appear in, placing high priority cards in
decks that appear higher in the list. When computers sort text
alphabetically, the “-” character comes before alphabetical characters,
and “~” comes after them. So you could call the deck “-Vocab” to make
them appear first, and you could call the other deck “~My Textbook” to
force it to appear after everything else.</p>
<p>New cards and reviews are fetched separately, and Anki won’t wait until
both queues are empty before moving on to the next deck, so it’s
possible you’ll be exposed to new cards from one deck while seeing
reviews from another deck, or vice versa. If you don’t want this, click
directly on the deck you want to study instead of one of the parent
decks.</p>
<p>Since cards in learning are somewhat time-critical, they are fetched
from all decks at once and shown in the order they are due.</p>
<p>To control the order reviews from a given deck appear in, or change new
cards from ordered to random order, please see the <a href="deck-options.html">deck
options</a>. For more fine-grained ordering of new cards, you
can change the order in the <a href="browsing.html">browser</a>.</p>
<h2 id="siblings-and-burying"><a class="header" href="#siblings-and-burying">Siblings and Burying</a></h2>
<p>Recall from <a href="getting-started.html">the basics</a> that Anki can create more than one
card for each thing you input, such as a front→back card and a
back→front card, or two different cloze deletions from the same text.
These related cards are called 'siblings'.</p>
<p>When you answer a card that has siblings, Anki can prevent the card’s
siblings from being shown in the same session by automatically 'burying'
them. Buried cards are hidden from review until the clock rolls over to
a new day or you manually unbury them using the “Unbury” button that’s
visible at the bottom of the <a href="studying.html#study-overview">deck overview</a> screen. Anki
will bury siblings even if the siblings are not in the same deck (for
instance, if you use the <a href="templates/intro.html">deck override</a> feature).</p>
<p>You can enable burying from the <a href="deck-options.html">deck options</a> screen -
there are separate settings for new cards and reviews.</p>
<p>Anki will only bury siblings that are new or review cards. It will not
hide cards in learning, as time is of the essence for those cards. On
the other hand, when you study a learning card, any new/review siblings
will be buried.</p>
<p>Note: A card cannot be buried and suspended at the same time. Suspending a
buried card will unbury it. Burying a suspended card does not work on Anki
2.1.49+, whereas on earlier versions, it will unsuspend the card.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts"><a class="header" href="#keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</a></h2>
<p>Most of the common operations in Anki have keyboard shortcuts. Most of
them are discoverable in the interface: menu items list their shortcuts
next to them, and hovering the mouse cursor over a button will generally
show its shortcut in a tooltip.</p>
<p>When studying, either <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> will show the answer. When the
answer is shown, you can use <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the Good button.
You can use the <kbd>1</kbd>-<kbd>4</kbd> keys to select a specific ease button. Many people
find it convenient to answer most cards with <kbd>Space</kbd> and keep one finger
on <kbd>1</kbd> for when they forget.</p>
<p>The &quot;Study Deck&quot; item in the Tools menu allows you to quickly switch to
a deck with the keyboard. You can trigger it with the '/' key. When
opened, it will display all of your decks and show a filter area at the
top. As you type characters, Anki will display only decks matching the
characters you type. You can add a space to separate multiple search
terms, and Anki will show only decks that match all the terms. So “ja 1”
or “on1 ja” would both match a deck called “Japanese::Lesson1”.</p>
<h2 id="falling-behind"><a class="header" href="#falling-behind">Falling Behind</a></h2>
<p>If you fall behind in your reviews, Anki will prioritize cards that have
been waiting the longest. It does this by taking the cards that have
been waiting the longest and showing them to you in a random order up
until your daily review limit. This ordering ensures that no cards will
be left waiting indefinitely, but it means that if you introduce new
cards, their reviews won’t appear until you’ve gotten through your
backlog.</p>
<p>If you wish to change the order of the overdue reviews, you can do so by
creating a <a href="filtered-decks.html">filtered deck</a>.</p>
<p>When you answer cards that have been waiting for a while, Anki factors
in that delay when determining the next time a card should be shown.
Please see the section on Anki’s spaced-repetition
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/due-times-after-a-break.html">algorithm</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="adding-cards-and-notes"><a class="header" href="#adding-cards-and-notes">Adding Cards and Notes</a></h2>
<p>Recall from the <a href="getting-started.html">basics</a> that in Anki we add notes rather than
cards, and Anki creates cards for us. Click 'Add' in the main window,
and the Add Notes window will appear.</p>
<p>The top left of the window shows us the current note type. If it does
not say &quot;Basic,&quot; then you may have added some note types when you
downloaded a shared deck. The text below assumes that &quot;Basic&quot; is
selected.</p>
<p>The top right of the window shows us the deck cards will be added to. If
you would like to add cards to a new deck, you can click on the deck name
button and then click &quot;Add&quot;.</p>
<p>Below the note type, you'll see some buttons, and an area labelled
&quot;Front&quot; and &quot;Back&quot;. Front and Back are called 'fields', and you can add,
remove, and rename them by clicking the &quot;Fields…​&quot; button above.</p>
<p>Below the fields is another area labelled &quot;Tags&quot;. Tags are labels that
you can attach to your notes, to make organizing and finding notes
easier. You can leave the tags blank if you wish, or add one or more of
them. Tags are separated by a space. If the tags area says</p>
<pre><code>vocab check_with_tutor
</code></pre>
<p>…​then the note you add would have two tags.</p>
<p>When you have entered text into the front and back, you can click the
&quot;Add&quot; button or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on a Mac) to add the
note to your collection. When you do so, a card will be created as well,
and placed into the deck you chose. If you would like to edit a card you
added, you can click the history button to search for a recently added
card in the <a href="browsing.html">browser</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on the buttons between the note type and the
fields, please see the <a href="editing.html">editor</a> section.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-check"><a class="header" href="#duplicate-check">Duplicate Check</a></h3>
<p>Anki checks the first field for uniqueness, so it will warn you if you
enter two cards with a Front field of &quot;apple&quot; (for example). The
uniqueness check is limited to the current note type, so if you're
studying multiple languages, two cards with the same Front would not be
listed as duplicates as long as you had a different note type for each
language.</p>
<p>Anki does not check for duplicates in other fields automatically for
efficiency reasons, but the browser has a &quot;Find Duplicates&quot; function,
which you can run periodically.</p>
<h3 id="effective-learning"><a class="header" href="#effective-learning">Effective Learning</a></h3>
<p>Different people like to review in different ways, but there are some
general concepts to keep in mind. An excellent introduction is <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">this
article</a> on the SuperMemo
site. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong>: The shorter your cards, the easier they are to
review. You may be tempted to include lots of information &quot;just in
case,&quot; but reviews will quickly become painful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don't memorize without understanding</strong>: If you are studying a
language, try to avoid large lists of words. The best way to learn
languages is in context, which means seeing those words used in a
sentence. Likewise, imagine you're studying a computer course. If
you attempt to memorize the mountain of acronyms, you'll find it
very difficult to make progress. But if you take the time to
understand the concepts behind the acronyms, learning the acronyms
will become a lot easier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adding-a-note-type"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-note-type">Adding a Note Type</a></h2>
<p>While basic note types are sufficient for simple cards with only a word
or phrase on each side, as soon as you find yourself wanting to include
more than one piece of information on the front or back, it's better to
split that information up into more fields.</p>
<p>You may find yourself thinking &quot;but I only want one card, so why can't I
just include the audio, a picture, a hint, and the translation in the
Front field?&quot; If you'd prefer to do that, that's fine. But the
disadvantage of that approach is that all the information is stuck
together. If you wanted to sort your cards by the hint, you wouldn't be
able to do that as it is mixed in with the other content. You also
wouldn't be able to do things such as moving the audio from the front to the
back, except by laboriously copying and pasting it for every note. By
keeping content in separate fields, you make it much easier to adjust
the layout of your cards in the future.</p>
<p>To create a new type of note, choose Tools → Manage Note Types from the
main Anki window. Then click &quot;Add&quot; to add a new type of note. You will now
see another screen that gives you a choice of note types to base the new
type on. &quot;Add&quot; means to base the newly created type on one that comes
with Anki. &quot;Clone&quot; means to base the newly created type on one that is
already in your collection. For instance, if you'd created a French
vocab type already, you might want to clone that when creating a German
vocab type.</p>
<p>After choosing OK, you will be asked to name the new type. The subject
material that you are studying is a good choice here – things like &quot;Japanese&quot;,
&quot;Trivia&quot;, and so on. Once you have chosen a name, close the Note Types
window, and you will return to the adding window.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-fields"><a class="header" href="#customizing-fields">Customizing Fields</a></h2>
<p>To customize fields, click the &quot;Fields…​&quot; button when adding or editing
a note, or while the note type is selected in the Manage Note Types
window.</p>
<p>You can add, remove, or rename fields by clicking the appropriate
buttons. To change the order in which the fields appear in this dialog
and the add notes dialog, you can use the reposition button, which asks
for the numerical position you want the field to have. So if you want to
change a field to be the new first field, enter &quot;1&quot;.</p>
<p>Do not use 'Tags', 'Type', 'Deck', 'Card', or 'FrontSide' as field
names, as they are <a href="templates/fields.html#special-fields">special fields</a> and will not work
properly.</p>
<p>The options at the bottom of the screen allow you to edit various
properties of the fields to be used when adding and editing the cards.
This is <em>not</em> where you customize what appears on your cards when
reviewing; for that, please see <a href="templates/intro.html">templates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Editing Font</strong> allows you to customize the font and size used when
editing notes. This is useful if you want to make unimportant
information smaller, or increase the size of foreign characters which
are hard to read. The changes you make here do not affect how cards
appear when reviewing: to do that, please see the
<a href="templates/intro.html">templates</a> section. If you have enabled the &quot;type in the
answer&quot; function, however, the text you type will use the font size
defined here. (For information about how to change the actual font face
when typing the answer, please see the <a href="templates/fields.html#checking-your-answer">checking your
answer</a> section.)</p>
<p><strong>Sort by this field…​</strong> tells Anki to show this field in the Sort Field
column of the browser. You can use this to sort cards by that field.
Only one field can be the sort field at once.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse text direction</strong> is useful if you are studying languages that
display text from right to left (RTL), such as Arabic or Hebrew. This
setting currently only controls editing; to make sure the text displays
correctly during review, you'll need to adjust your
<a href="templates/styling.html#text-direction">template</a>.</p>
<p>After you have added fields, you will probably want to add them to the front
or back of your cards. For more information on that, please see the
<a href="templates/intro.html">templates</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="changing-deck--note-type"><a class="header" href="#changing-deck--note-type">Changing Deck / Note Type</a></h2>
<p>While adding, you can click on the top left button to change note type,
and the top right button to change deck. The window that opens up will
not only allow you to select a deck or note type, but also to add new
decks or manage your note types.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-content"><a class="header" href="#organizing-content">Organizing Content</a></h2>
<h3 id="using-decks-appropriately"><a class="header" href="#using-decks-appropriately">Using Decks Appropriately</a></h3>
<p><a href="getting-started.html#decks">Decks</a> are designed to divide your content up into
broad categories that you wish to study separately, such as English, Geography,
and so on. You may be tempted to create lots of little decks to keep your
content organized, such as &quot;my geography book chapter 1&quot;, or &quot;food verbs&quot;, but
this is not recommended, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lots of little decks may mean you end up seeing cards in a
recognizable order. On older scheduler versions, new cards can only
be introduced in deck order. And if you were planning to click on each deck
in turn (which is slow), you will end up seeing all the &quot;chapter 1&quot; or
&quot;food verb&quot; reviews together. This makes it easier to answer the
cards, as you can guess them from the context, which leads to weaker
memories. When you need to recall the word or phrase outside Anki,
you won't always have the luxury of being shown related content first!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While less of a problem than it was in earlier Anki versions,
adding hundreds of decks may cause slowdowns, and very large deck
trees with thousands of items can actually break the display of
the deck list in Anki versions before 2.1.50.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-tags"><a class="header" href="#using-tags">Using Tags</a></h3>
<p>Instead of creating lots of little decks, it's a better idea to use tags
and/or fields to classify your content. Tags are a useful way to boost 
search results, find specific content, and keep your collection 
organized.
There are many ways of using tags and flags effectively, and
thinking in advance about how you want to use them will help you decide
what will work best for you.</p>
<p>Some people prefer using decks and subdecks to keep their cards organized,
but using tags have a big advantage over decks for that: you can add several
tags to a single note, but a single card can only belong to one deck, which 
makes tags a more powerful and flexible categorization system than 
decks in most cases. </p>
<p>For example, instead of creating a &quot;food verbs&quot; deck, you could add those 
cards to your main language study deck, and tag the cards with &quot;food&quot; and
&quot;verb&quot;. Since each card can have multiple tags, you can do things like 
<a href="searching.html#tags-decks-cards-and-notes">search</a> for all verbs, or all 
food-related vocabulary, or all verbs that are related to food. </p>
<p>You can add tags from the Edit window and from the <a href="browsing.html">Browser</a>, and you can also add,
delete, rename, or organize tags there. Please note that
tags work at <a href="getting-started.html#notes--fields">note</a> level, which means that when you tag a card that has siblings,
all the siblings will be tagged as well. If you need to tag a single card,
but not its siblings, you should consider using flags instead.</p>
<h3 id="using-flags"><a class="header" href="#using-flags">Using Flags</a></h3>
<p>Flags are similar to tags, but they will appear during study in the review 
window, showing a colored flag icon on the upper right area of the screen. 
You can also search for flagged cards in the Browse screen, rename flags 
from the browser and create filtered decks from flagged cards, but unlike tags, 
a single card can have only one flag at a time. Another important difference
is that flags work at <a href="getting-started.html#cards">card</a> level, so flagging a card that have siblings 
won't have any effect on the card's siblings. </p>
<p>You can flag / unflag cards directly while in review mode (by pressing 
<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>1-7</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>1-7</kbd> on Mac) 
and from the <a href="browsing.html">Browser.</a></p>
<h3 id="the-marked-tag"><a class="header" href="#the-marked-tag">The &quot;Marked&quot; Tag</a></h3>
<p>Anki treats a tag called &quot;marked&quot; specially. There are options in the review
screen and browse screen to add and remove the &quot;marked&quot; tag. The review screen 
will show a star when the current card's note has that tag. And cards are 
shown in a different color in the browse screen when their note is marked.</p>
<p>Note: Marking is mainly left around for compatibility with older Anki 
versions; most users will want to use flags instead.</p>
<h3 id="using-fields"><a class="header" href="#using-fields">Using Fields</a></h3>
<p>For those who like to stay very organized, you can add fields to your
notes to classify your content, such as &quot;book&quot;, &quot;page&quot;, and so on. Anki
supports searching in specific fields, which means you can do a search
for &quot;book:'my book' page:63&quot; and immediately find what you're looking
for.</p>
<h3 id="custom-study-and-filtered-decks"><a class="header" href="#custom-study-and-filtered-decks">Custom Study and Filtered Decks</a></h3>
<p>Using <a href="filtered-decks.html">custom study and filtered deck</a> you can create 
temporary decks out of search
terms. This allows you to review your content mixed together in a single
deck most of the time (for optimum memory), but also create temporary
decks when you need to focus on particular material, such as before a
test. The general rule is that if you always want to be able to study
some content separately, it should be in a normal deck; if you only
occasionally need to be able to study it separately (for a test, when
under a backlog, etc.), then filtered decks created from tags, flags, 
marks or fields are better.</p>
<h2 id="editing-features"><a class="header" href="#editing-features">Editing Features</a></h2>
<p>The editor is shown when <a href="editing.html">adding notes</a>, <a href="studying.html">editing a
note</a> during reviews, or <a href="browsing.html">browsing</a>.</p>
<p>On the top left are two buttons, which open the <a href="editing.html#customizing-fields">fields</a> and
<a href="templates/intro.html">cards</a> windows.</p>
<p>On the right are buttons that control formatting. Bold, italic and
underline work like they do in a word processing program. The next two
buttons allow you to subscript or superscript text, which is useful for
chemical compounds like H<sub>2</sub>O or simple mathematical equations like
x<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The rubber eraser button clears any formatting in the currently selected text — including the colour
of the text,  whether the selected text is bold, etc.</p>
<p>The next three buttons allow creating lists, text alignment and text indent.
Then, there are two buttons to allow you to change text colour.</p>
<p>The […​] button is visible when a cloze note type is selected.</p>
<p>You can use the paper-clip button to select audio, images, and videos from
your computer's hard drive and attach them to your notes. Alternatively, you
can copy the media onto your computer's clipboard (for instance, by
right-clicking an image on the web and choosing 'Copy Image') and paste
it into the field that you want to place it in. For more information
about media, please see the <a href="media.html">media</a> section.</p>
<p>The microphone icon allows you to record from your computer's microphone
and attach the recording to the note.</p>
<p>The Fx button shows shortcuts to add MathJax or
<a href="math.html">LaTeX</a> to your notes.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;/&gt;</code> button allows editing the underlying HTML of a field.</p>
<p>Anki 2.1.45+ supports adjusting sticky fields directly from the editing screen.
If you click on the pin icon on the right of a field, Anki will not clear out
the field's content after a note is added. If you find yourself entering the
same content into multiple notes, you may find this useful. On previous Anki
versions, sticky fields were toggled from the Fields screen.</p>
<p>Most of the buttons have shortcut keys. You can hover the mouse cursor
over a button to see its shortcut.</p>
<p>When pasting text, Anki will keep most formatting by default. If you
hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while pasting, Anki will strip most of the
formatting. Under Preferences, you can toggle &quot;Paste without shift
key strips formatting&quot; to modify the default behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="cloze-deletion"><a class="header" href="#cloze-deletion">Cloze Deletion</a></h2>
<p>'Cloze deletion' is the process of hiding one or more words in a
sentence. For example, if you have the sentence:</p>
<pre><code>Canberra was founded in 1913.
</code></pre>
<p>…​and you create a cloze deletion on &quot;1913&quot;, then the sentence would
become:</p>
<pre><code>Canberra was founded in [...].
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes sections that have been removed in this fashion are said to be
'occluded'.</p>
<p>For more information on why you might want to use cloze deletion, see
Rule 5 <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anki provides a special cloze deletion type of note, to make creating
clozes easy. To create a cloze deletion note, select the Cloze note
type, and type some text into the &quot;Text&quot; field. Then drag the mouse over
the text you want to hide to select it, and click the […​] button.
Anki will replace the text with:</p>
<pre><code>Canberra was founded in {{c1::1913}}.
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;c1&quot; part means that you have created one cloze deletion on the
sentence. You can create more than one deletion if you'd like. For
example, if you select Canberra and click […​] again, the text will
now look like:</p>
<pre><code>{{c2::Canberra}} was founded in {{c1::1913}}.
</code></pre>
<p>When you add the above note, Anki will create two cards. The first card
will show:</p>
<pre><code>Canberra was founded in [...].
</code></pre>
<p>…​on the question, with the full sentence on the answer. The other card
will have the following on the question:</p>
<pre><code>[...] was founded in 1913.
</code></pre>
<p>You can also elide multiple sections on the same card. In the above
example, if you change c2 to c1, only one card would be created, with
both Canberra and 1913 hidden. If you hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> (<kbd>Option</kbd> on a Mac)
while creating a cloze, Anki will automatically use the same number
instead of incrementing it.</p>
<p>Cloze deletions don't need to fall on word boundaries, so if you select
&quot;anberra&quot; rather than &quot;Canberra&quot; in the above example, the question
would appear as &quot;C[…​] was founded in 1913&quot;, giving you a hint.</p>
<p>You can also give yourself hints that don't match the text. If you
replace the original sentence with:</p>
<pre><code>Canberra::city was founded in 1913
</code></pre>
<p>…​and then press […​] after selecting &quot;Canberra::city&quot;, Anki will
treat the text after the two colons as a hint, changing the text into:</p>
<pre><code>{{c1::Canberra::city}} was founded in 1913
</code></pre>
<p>When the card comes up for review, it will appear as:</p>
<pre><code>[city] was founded in 1913.
</code></pre>
<p>For information on testing your ability to type in a cloze deletion
correctly, please see the section on <a href="templates/fields.html#checking-your-answer">typing answers</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that overlapping clozes are not supported. For example, the
following field is invalid:</p>
<pre><code>{{c1::Canberra was {{c2::founded}}}} in 1913
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to create clozes from overlapping text, add another Text
field to your cloze, add it to the <a href="templates/intro.html">template</a>, and then when
creating notes, paste the text into two separate fields, like so:</p>
<pre><code>Text1 field: {{c1::Canberra was founded}} in 1913

Text2 field: {{c2::Canberra}} was founded in 1913
</code></pre>
<p>The default cloze note type has a second field called Extra, that is
shown on the answer side of each card. It can be used for adding some
usage notes or extra information.</p>
<p>The cloze note type is treated specially by Anki, and cannot be created
based on a regular note type. If you wish to customize it, please make
sure to clone the existing Cloze type instead of another type of note.
Things like formatting can be customized, but it is not possible to add
extra card templates to the cloze note type.</p>
<h2 id="inputting-foreign-characters-and-accents"><a class="header" href="#inputting-foreign-characters-and-accents">Inputting Foreign Characters and Accents</a></h2>
<p>All modern computers have built-in support for typing accents and
foreign characters, and multiple ways to go about it. The method we
recommend is by using a keyboard layout for the language you want to learn.</p>
<p>Languages with a separate script like Japanese, Chinese, Thai, and so on,
have their own layouts specific to that language.</p>
<p>European languages that use accents may have their own layout, but can
often by typed on a generic &quot;international keyboard&quot; layout. These work
by typing the accent, then the character you want accented - e.g. an
apostrophe (') then the letter a (a) gives á.</p>
<p>To add the international keyboard on Windows machines, please see
<a href="http://www.techlanguage.com/tips/us_international.html">http://www.techlanguage.com/tips/us_international.html</a></p>
<p>To add it on Macs, please see
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1147039/os-x/accentinput.html">http://www.macworld.com/article/1147039/os-x/accentinput.html</a></p>
<p>Keyboards for a specific language are added in a similar way, but we can
not cover them all here. For more information, please try searching
Google for &quot;input Japanese on a mac&quot;, &quot;type Chinese on Windows 10&quot;, and
so on.</p>
<p>If you are learning a right-to-left language, there are lots of other
things to consider. Please see <a href="http://dotancohen.com/howto/rtl_right_to_left.html">this
page</a> for more
information.</p>
<p>The toolkit on which Anki is built has trouble dealing with a few input
methods, such as holding down keys to select accented characters on macOS, 
and typing characters by holding down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and typing a
numeric code on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="unicode-normalization"><a class="header" href="#unicode-normalization">Unicode Normalization</a></h2>
<p>Text like <code>á</code> can be represented in multiple ways on a computer, such as
using a specific code for that symbol, or by using a standard <code>a</code> and then
another code for the accent on top. This causes problems when mixing input
from different sources, or using different computers - if your computer
handles keyboard input in one form, but the content is stored in a different
form, it will not match when searching, even though the end result appears
identical.</p>
<p>To ensure content can easily be found in searches, Anki normalizes the text
to a standard form. For most users this process is transparent, but if you
are studying certain material like archaic Japanese symbols, the normalization
process can end up converting them to a more modern equivalent.</p>
<p>If you want character variants preserved, the following in the <a href="./misc.html">debug console</a>
will turn off normalization:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">mw.col.conf[&quot;normalize_note_text&quot;] = False
</code></pre>
<p>Any content added after that will remain untouched. The trade-off is that you may
find it difficult to search for the content if you're switching between operating
systems, or pasting content from mixed sources.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="card-templates"><a class="header" href="#card-templates">Card Templates</a></h1>
<p>Card templates tell Anki which fields should appear on the front and back of your card,
and control which cards will be generated when certain fields have text in them.
By adjusting your card templates, you can alter the design and styling of many of your
cards at once.</p>
<p>Card templates are covered in some of the intro videos:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-templates-screen"><a class="header" href="#the-templates-screen">The Templates Screen</a></h2>
<p>You can modify card templates by clicking the &quot;Cards...&quot; button inside the
editing screen.</p>
<p>For older Anki versions, on the top left is the front template, on the bottom left is the back
template, and in between them is the card styling section. For Anki versions
2.1.28+ the front, back, and styling are no longer shown at the same time.
You can switch between them with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>.</p>
<p>In Anki, templates are written in HTML, which is the language that web
pages are written in. The styling section is CSS, which is the language
used for styling web pages.</p>
<p>On the right is a preview of the front and back of the currently
selected card. If you opened the window while adding notes, the preview
will be based on the text you had typed into the Add Notes window. If
you opened the window while editing a note, the preview will be based on
the content of that note. If you opened the window from Tools → Manage
Note Types, Anki will display each field’s name in parentheses in place
of content.</p>
<p>At the top right of the window is an Options button that gives you
options to rename or reorder the cards, as well as the following two
options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 'Deck Override' option allows you to change the deck that cards
generated from the current card type will be placed into. By
default, cards are placed into the deck you provide in the Add Notes
window. If you set a deck here, that card type will be placed into
the deck you specified, instead of the deck listed in the Add Notes
window. This can be useful if you want to separate cards into
different decks (for instance, when studying a language, to put
production cards in one deck and recognition cards in another). You
can check which deck the cards are currently going to by choosing
Deck Override again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 'Browser Appearance' option allows you to set different (perhaps
simplified) templates for display in the Question and Answer columns
of the browser; see <a href="templates/styling.html#browser-appearance">browser appearance</a> for more

<h2 id="basic-replacements"><a class="header" href="#basic-replacements">Basic Replacements</a></h2>
<p>The most basic template looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{{Front}}
</code></pre>
<p>When you place text within curly brackets, Anki looks for a field by
that name, and replaces the text with the actual content of the field.</p>
<p>Field names are case sensitive. If you have a field named <code>Front</code>,
writing <code>{{front}}</code> will not work properly.</p>
<p>Your templates are not limited to a list of fields. You can also include
arbitrary text on your templates. For example, if you’re studying
capital cities, and you’ve created a note type with a “Country” field,
you might create a front template like this:</p>
<pre><code>What's the capital city of {{Country}}?
</code></pre>
<p>The default back template will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{{FrontSide}}

&lt;hr id=answer&gt;

{{Back}}
</code></pre>
<p>This means “show me the text that’s on the front side, then a divider
line, and then the Back field”.</p>
<p>The 'id=answer' part tells Anki where the divider is between the
question and the answer. This allows Anki to automatically scroll to the
spot where the answer starts when you press 'show answer' on a long card
(especially useful on mobile devices with small screens). If you don’t
want a horizontal line at the beginning of the answer, you can use
another HTML element such as a paragraph or div instead.</p>
<h2 id="newlines"><a class="header" href="#newlines">Newlines</a></h2>
<p>Card templates are like web pages, which means a special command is required
to create a new line. For example, if you wrote the following in the template:</p>
<pre><code>one
two
</code></pre>
<p>In the preview, you’d actually see:</p>
<pre><code>one two
</code></pre>
<p>To add a new line, you need to add a &lt;br&gt; code to the end of a
line, like so:</p>
<pre><code>one&lt;br&gt;
two
</code></pre>
<p>The br code stands for &quot;(line) br(eak)&quot;.</p>
<p>The same applies for fields. If you want to display two fields, one on
each line, you would use</p>
<pre><code>{{Field 1}}&lt;br&gt;
{{Field 2}}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="text-to-speech"><a class="header" href="#text-to-speech">Text to Speech</a></h2>
<p>This feature requires Anki 2.1.20, or AnkiMobile 2.0.56. AnkiDroid does
not currently support this method.</p>
<p>To have Anki read the Front field in a US English voice, you can place
the following in your card template:</p>
<pre><code>{{tts en_US:Front}}
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, macOS, and iOS, Anki will use the OS’s built in voices. On
Linux, no voices are built in, but voices can be provided by add-ons,
such as <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/391644525">this one</a>.</p>
<p>To see a list of all available languages/voices, place the following on
your card template:</p>
<pre><code>{{tts-voices:}}
</code></pre>
<p>If there are multiple voices that support your chosen language, you can
specify desired voices in a list, and Anki will choose the first
available voice. For example:</p>
<pre><code>{{tts ja_JP voices=Apple_Otoya,Microsoft_Haruka:Field}}
</code></pre>
<p>This would use Otoya when on an Apple device, and Haruka when on a
Windows PC.</p>
<p>Specifying a different speed is possible in some TTS implementations:</p>
<pre><code>{{tts fr_FR speed=0.8:SomeField}}
</code></pre>
<p>Both speed and voices are optional, but the language must be included.</p>
<p>On a Mac, you can customize the available voices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open the System Preferences screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on Accessibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on Speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the system voice dropdown, and choose Customize.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some voices sound better than others, so experiment to choose the one
you prefer. Please note that the Siri voice can only be used by Apple
apps. Once you’ve installed new voices, you’ll need to restart Anki for
the new voices to become available.</p>
<p>On Windows, some voices like Cortana can not be selected, as Microsoft
does not make those voices available to other applications.</p>
<p>On a cloze note type, you can make Anki read only the elided sections
using the <code>cloze-only</code> filter, like so:</p>
<pre><code>{{tts en_US:cloze-only:Text}}
</code></pre>
<p>The cloze-only filter is supported in Anki 2.1.29+ and AnkiMobile 2.0.65+.</p>
<h2 id="special-fields"><a class="header" href="#special-fields">Special Fields</a></h2>
<p>There are some special fields you can include in your templates:</p>
<pre><code>The note's tags: {{Tags}}

The type of note: {{Type}}

The card's deck: {{Deck}}

The card's subdeck: {{Subdeck}}

The type of card (&quot;Forward&quot;, etc): {{Card}}

The content of the front template
(only valid in back template): {{FrontSide}}
</code></pre>
<p>FrontSide will not automatically play any audio that was on the front side
of the card. If you wish to have the same audio play automatically on both
the front and back of the card, you’ll need to manually include the audio
fields on the back as well.</p>
<p>As with other fields, special field names are case sensitive - you must use
<code>{{Tags}}</code> rather than <code>{{tags}}</code> for example.</p>
<h2 id="hint-fields"><a class="header" href="#hint-fields">Hint Fields</a></h2>
<p>It’s possible to add a field to the front or back of a card, but make it
hidden until you explicitly show it. We call this a 'hint field'. Before
adding a hint, please bear in mind that the easier you make it to answer
a question in Anki, the less likely you are to remember that question
when you encounter it in real life. Please have a read about the
'minimum information principle' on
<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm</a> before proceeding.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to add a field to store the hint in if you have not
already. Please see the <a href="templates/../editing.html#customizing-fields">fields</a> section if you’re not sure how
to do this.</p>
<p>Assuming you’ve created a field called MyField, you can tell Anki to
include it on the card but hide it by default by adding the following to
your template:</p>
<pre><code>{{hint:MyField}}
</code></pre>
<p>This will show a link labeled “show hint”; when you click it, the
content of the field will be displayed on the card. (If MyField is
empty, nothing will be shown.)</p>
<p>If you show the hint on the question and then reveal the answer, the
hint will be hidden again. If you want to have the hint always revealed
when the answer is shown, you will need to remove <code>{{FrontSide}}</code> from
your back template and manually add the fields you wish to appear.</p>
<p>It is not currently possible to use a hint field for audio — the audio
will play regardless of whether you’ve clicked on the hint link.</p>
<p>If you want to customize the appearance or behaviour, you’ll need to
implement the hint field yourself. We can not provide any support for
doing so, but the following code should get you started:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Back}}
﻿&lt;a class=hint href=&quot;#&quot;
onclick=&quot;this.style.display='none';document.getElementById('hint4753594160').style.display='inline-block';return false;&quot;&gt;
Show Back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;hint4753594160&quot; class=hint style=&quot;display: none&quot;&gt;{{Back}}&lt;/div&gt;
{{/Back}}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dictionary-links"><a class="header" href="#dictionary-links">Dictionary Links</a></h2>
<p>You can also use field replacement to create dictionary links. Imagine
you’re studying a language and your favourite online dictionary allows
you to search for text using a web URL like:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/search?q=myword
</code></pre>
<p>You could add an automatic link by doing the following in your template:</p>
<pre><code>{{Expression}}

&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/search?q={{Expression}}&quot;&gt;check in dictionary&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The template above would allow you to search for each note’s expression
by clicking on the link while reviewing. There is a caveat however, so
please see the next section.</p>
<h2 id="html-stripping"><a class="header" href="#html-stripping">HTML Stripping</a></h2>
<p>Like templates, fields are stored in HTML. In the dictionary link
example above, if the expression contained the word &quot;myword&quot; without any
formatting, then the HTML would be the same: &quot;myword&quot;. But when you
include formatting in your fields, extra HTML is included. If &quot;myword&quot;
was bolded for example, the actual HTML would be
&quot;&lt;b&gt;myword&lt;/b&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p>This can present a problem for things like dictionary links. In the
above example, the dictionary link would end up being:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/search?q=&lt;b&gt;myword&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&gt;check in dictionary&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The extra characters in the link would likely confuse the dictionary
site, and you’re likely not to get any matches.</p>
<p>To solve this, Anki provides the ability to strip formatting from fields
when they are replaced. If you prefix a field name with text:, Anki will
not include any formatting. So a dictionary link that worked even with
formatted text would be:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/search?q={{text:Expression}}&quot;&gt;check in dictionary&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="right-to-left-text"><a class="header" href="#right-to-left-text">Right To Left Text</a></h2>
<p>If you’re using a language that reads from right to left, you’ll need
to adjust the template like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div dir=rtl&gt;{{FieldThatHasRTLTextInIt}}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="media--latex"><a class="header" href="#media--latex">Media &amp; LaTeX</a></h2>
<p>Anki does not scan templates for media references, because it is slow to
do so. This has implications for including media on the template.</p>
<h3 id="static-soundsimages"><a class="header" href="#static-soundsimages">Static Sounds/Images</a></h3>
<p>If you wish to include images or sounds on your cards that are the same
for every card (eg, a company logo at the top of each card):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rename the file so it starts with an underscore, eg &quot;_logo.jpg&quot;.
The underscore tells Anki that the file is used by the template and
it should be exported when sharing the deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a reference to the media on your front or back template, like:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;_logo.jpg&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="field-references"><a class="header" href="#field-references">Field References</a></h3>
<p>Media references to fields are not supported. They may or may not display
during review, and will not work when checking for unused media,
importing/exporting, and so on. Examples that won’t work:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;{{Expression}}.jpg&quot;&gt;

[sound:{{Word}}]

[latex]{{Field 1}}[/latex]
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, you should include the media references in the field. Please
see the <a href="templates/../importing.html#importing-media">importing section</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="checking-your-answer"><a class="header" href="#checking-your-answer">Checking Your Answer</a></h2>
<p>You can watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tYObQ3ocrw&amp;yt:cc=on">a video about this
feature</a> on
YouTube.</p>
<p>The easiest way to check your answer is to click &quot;Basic&quot; at the top
left of the card adding screen, and select &quot;Basic (type in the answer)&quot;.</p>
<p>If you have downloaded a shared deck and would like to type in the answer
with it, you can modify its card template. If it has a template like:</p>
<pre><code>{{Native Word}}

{{FrontSide}}

&lt;hr id=answer&gt;

{{Foreign Word}}
</code></pre>
<p>To type in the foreign word and check if you are correct, you need to
edit your front template so that it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>{{Native Word}}
{{type:Foreign Word}}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we have added <code>type:</code> in front of the field we want to
compare. Since FrontSide is on the back of the card, the type answer box
will appear on the back as well.</p>
<p>When reviewing, Anki will display a text box where you can type in the
answer, and upon hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> or showing the answer, Anki will show you
which parts you got right and which parts you got wrong. The text box’s
font size will be the size you configured for that field (via the
“Fields” button when editing).</p>
<p>This feature does not change how the cards are answered, so it’s still
up to you to decide how well you remembered or not.</p>
<p>Only one typing comparison can be used on a card. If you add the above
text multiple times, it will not work. It also only supports a single
line, so it is not useful for comparing against a field that is
comprised on multiple lines.</p>
<p>Anki uses a monospaced font for the answer comparison so that the
“provided” and “correct” sections line up. If you wish to override the
font for the answer comparison, you can put the following at the bottom
of your styling section:</p>
<pre><code>code#typeans { font-family: &quot;myfontname&quot;; }
</code></pre>
<p>Which will affect the following HTML for the answer comparison:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;code id=typeans&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Advanced users can override the default type-answer colors with the css
classes 'typeGood', 'typeBad' and 'typeMissed'. AnkiMobile supports
'typeGood' and 'typeBad', but not 'typeMissed'.</p>
<p>If you wish to override the size of the typing box and don’t want to
change the font in the Fields dialog, you can override the default
inline style using <code>!important</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code>#typeans { font-size: 50px !important; }
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to type in the answer for cloze deletion cards. To
do this, add <code>{{type:cloze:Text}}</code> to both the front and back
template, so the back looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{{cloze:Text}}
{{type:cloze:Text}}
{{Extra}}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that since the cloze type does not use FrontSide, this must be
added to both sides on a cloze note type.</p>
<p>If there are multiple sections elided, you can separate the answers in
the text box with a comma.</p>
<p>Type answer boxes will not appear in the <a href="templates/intro.html">&quot;preview&quot;
dialog</a> in the browser. When you review or look at
the preview in the card types window, they will display.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-cards"><a class="header" href="#reverse-cards">Reverse Cards</a></h2>
<p>You can watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnbKwHEQ1mA&amp;yt:cc=on">a video about reversing
cards</a> on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you want to create cards that go in both directions (e.g., both
“ookii”→“big” and “big”→“ookii”), you have several options. The simplest
is to select the “Basic (and reversed card)” built-in note type. This
will generate two cards, one in each direction.</p>
<p>If you want to generate reverse cards for only some of your material
(perhaps you only want to take the time to study reverses for the most
important material, or some of your cards don’t make sense reversed),
you can select the “Basic (optional reversed card)” note type. This note
type generates a forward-only card when you fill in only the first two
fields; if you additionally enter something in the “Add Reverse” field
(like a 'y'), Anki will generate a reverse card as well. The contents of
this field will never be displayed on a card.</p>
<h2 id="card-generation--deletion"><a class="header" href="#card-generation--deletion">Card Generation &amp; Deletion</a></h2>
<p>Anki will not create cards with empty front sides. Thus if “My Field”
was empty, and one card’s front template included only that field, the
card would not be created.</p>
<p>If no cards can be created because all of the cards would have empty
front sides, then the Add Notes window will warn you and not allow the
note to be added until at least one card would be generated.</p>
<p>When you edit a previously added note, Anki will automatically create
extra cards if they were previously blank but no longer are. If your
edits have made some cards blank when they previously were not, however,
Anki will not delete them immediately, as that could lead to accidental
data loss. To remove the empty cards, go to Tools → Empty Cards in the
main window. You will be shown a list of empty cards and be given the
option to delete them.</p>
<p>Because of the way that card generation works, it is not possible to
manually delete individual cards, as they would just end up being recreated
the next time the note was edited. Instead, you should make the
relevant conditional replacement fields empty and then use the Empty
Cards option.</p>
<p>Anki does not consider special fields or non-field text for the purposes
of card generation. Thus if your front template looked like the
following, no card would be generated if Country was empty:</p>
<pre><code>Where is {{Country}} on the map?
</code></pre>
<h2 id="selective-card-generation"><a class="header" href="#selective-card-generation">Selective Card Generation</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you may want to generate extra cards for only some of your
material, such as testing your ability to recall the most important
words of a set. You can accomplish this by adding an extra field to your
note, and adding some text into it (such as &quot;1&quot;) on the notes you want
the extra card. Then in the card template, you can make the card’s
creation depend on that field being non-empty. For more information on
this, please see the conditional replacement section below.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-replacement"><a class="header" href="#conditional-replacement">Conditional Replacement</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to include certain text, fields, or HTML on your cards
only if a field is empty or not empty. An example:</p>
<pre><code>This text is always shown.

{{#FieldName}}
    This text is only shown if FieldName has text in it
{{/FieldName}}

{{^FieldName}}
    This text is only shown if FieldName is empty
{{/FieldName}}
</code></pre>
<p>A real life example is only showing a label if the field is not empty:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Tags}}
    Tags: {{Tags}}
{{/Tags}}
</code></pre>
<p>Or say you want to display a specific field in blue on the front of your
card if there are extra notes on the back (perhaps the fact that there
are notes serves as a reminder that you should spend more time thinking
about the answer). You can style the field as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Notes}}
    &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;
{{/Notes}}

{{FieldToFormat}}

{{#Notes}}
    &lt;/span&gt;
{{/Notes}}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use conditional replacement to control which cards are
generated. This works since Anki will not generate
cards which would have a blank front side. For
example, consider a card with two fields on the front:</p>
<pre><code>{{Expression}}
{{Notes}}
</code></pre>
<p>Normally a card would be generated if either the expression or notes
field had text in it. If you only wanted a card generated if expression
was not empty, then you could change the template to this:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Expression}}
    {{Expression}}
    {{Notes}}
{{/Expression}}
</code></pre>
<p>And if you wanted to require both fields, you could use two conditional
replacements:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Expression}}
    {{#Notes}}
        {{Expression}}
        {{Notes}}
    {{/Notes}}
{{/Expression}}
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that this only works when you place the
conditional replacement code on the <em>front</em> of the card; if you do this
on the back, you will simply end up with cards with a blank back side.
Similarly, since this works by checking if the front field would be
empty, it is important to make sure you wrap the 'entire' front side in
the conditional replacement; for instance, the following would not work
as expected:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Expression}}
    {{Expression}}
{{/Expression}}
{{Notes}}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="blank-back-sides"><a class="header" href="#blank-back-sides">Blank Back Sides</a></h2>
<p>Card generation only looks at the front side of the card. For example, if you have a
front template:</p>
<pre><code>{{Field 1}}
</code></pre>
<p>and a back template:</p>
<pre><code>{{Field 2}}
</code></pre>
<p>Then a card will be generated if Field 1 is non-empty. If Field 2 is empty, the card
will still be generated, and you will get a blank back side.</p>
<p>If you wish to avoid a blank back side, you will need to place a required field
on the front template as a conditional, like so:</p>
<pre><code>{{#Field 2}}
    {{Field 1}}
{{/Field 2}}
</code></pre>
<p>This will ensure the card is generated only if both Field 2 and Field 1 are non-empty.</p>
<h2 id="limitations-in-older-anki-versions"><a class="header" href="#limitations-in-older-anki-versions">Limitations in Older Anki Versions</a></h2>
<p>The following limitations do not apply to Anki 2.1.28+ and AnkiMobile 2.0.64+.</p>
<p>Older Anki versions cannot use negated conditionals for card generation.
For example, on Anki 2.1.28, the following would add a card if a field
called AddIfEmpty is empty, and Front is non-empty:</p>
<pre><code>{{^AddIfEmpty}}
    {{Front}}
{{/AddIfEmpty}}
</code></pre>
<p>On earlier Anki versions, the negated conditional is ignored, and card
generation will depend only on Front being non-empty.</p>
<p>Mixing <strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong> conditions can also cause problems on older versions.
For example, the following (&quot;add the card if A <strong>OR</strong> B <strong>OR</strong> C is non-empty&quot;)
is fine:</p>
<pre><code>{{A}}
{{B}}
{{C}}
</code></pre>
<p>And the following (&quot;add the card if A <strong>AND</strong> B <strong>AND</strong> C are non-empty&quot;) is fine:</p>
<pre><code>{{#A}}
    {{#B}}
        {{#C}}
            {{A}}
        {{/C}}
    {{/B}}
{{/A}}
</code></pre>
<p>But the following (&quot;add the card if A <strong>OR</strong> (B <strong>AND</strong> C) are non-empty&quot;) will not work properly:</p>
<pre><code>{{A}}
{{#B}}
    {{#C}}
        {{B}}
    {{/C}}
{{/B}}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="adding-empty-notes"><a class="header" href="#adding-empty-notes">Adding Empty Notes</a></h2>
<p>When you add a new note in Anki 2.1.28+ and AnkiMobile 2.0.64+, if the card
templates and note fields combine to produce no cards, a blank card will be
created using the first template. This allows you to add material even if it's
incomplete, and modify it or the template later to make it valid. If you don't
wish to keep an empty note, you can remove it with the Empty Cards function.</p>
<p>On older Anki versions, Anki refuses to add or import a note if no cards
would be generated.</p>
<h2 id="cloze-templates"><a class="header" href="#cloze-templates">Cloze Templates</a></h2>
<p>Please see the <a href="templates/../editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze deletion</a> section for background info.</p>
<p>The cloze note type functions differently from regular note types.
Instead of a customizable number of card types, it has a single type
which is shared by all cloze deletions on a note.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the card generation section above, generation of regular
cards depends on one or more fields on the question being non-empty.
Cloze deletion note types are generated differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anki looks on the front template for one or more cloze replacements,
like {{cloze:FieldName}}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It then looks in the FieldName field for all cloze references, like
{{c1::text}}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each separate number, a card will be generated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because card generation functions differently for cloze deletion cards,
{{cloze:…​}} tags can not be used with a regular note type - they
will only function properly when used with a cloze note type.</p>
<p>Conditional generation provides a special field so you can check which
card you are rendering. If you wanted to display the &quot;hint1&quot; field on
the first cloze, and &quot;hint2&quot; field on the second cloze for example, you
could use the following template:</p>
<pre><code>{{cloze:Text}}

{{#c1}}
    {{Hint1}}
{{/c1}}

{{#c2}}
    {{Hint2}}
{{/c2}}

<h2 id="card-styling"><a class="header" href="#card-styling">Card Styling</a></h2>
<p>You can watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1j1Zx0mXME&amp;yt:cc=on">a video about styling
cards</a> on YouTube.
The video shows Anki 2.0’s interface, but the concepts are largely the
same.</p>
<p>In between the front and back template in the Cards screen is the card
styling area. In that section, you can change the background color of
the card, the default font, the text alignment, and so on.</p>
<p>The standard options available to you are:</p>
<p><strong>font-family</strong><br />
The name of the font to use on the card. If your font has spaces in it
like &quot;MS Unicode&quot;, then you need to surround the font name in double
quotes as in this sentence. It is also possible to use multiple fonts on
one card; for information on that, please see below.</p>
<p><strong>font-size</strong><br />
The size of the font in pixels. When changing it, make sure you leave px
at the end.</p>
<p><strong>text-align</strong><br />
Whether the text should be aligned in the center, left, or right.</p>
<p><strong>color</strong><br />
The color of the text. Simple color names like 'blue', 'lightyellow',
and so on will work, or you can use HTML color codes to select arbitrary
colors. Please see <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">this webpage</a> for more
information.</p>
<p><strong>background-color</strong><br />
The color of the card background.</p>
<p>Any CSS can be placed in the styling section – advanced users may wish
to do things like add a background image or gradient, for example. If
you’re wondering how to get some particular formatting, please search
the web for information about how to do it in CSS, as there is a great
deal of documentation available.</p>
<p>The styling is shared between all cards, which means that when you make
an adjustment it will affect all cards for that note type. It is also
possible to specify card-specific styling, however. The following
example will use a yellow background on all cards except the first one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.card {
  background-color: yellow;
}
.card1 {
  background-color: blue;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="image-resizing"><a class="header" href="#image-resizing">Image Resizing</a></h2>
<p>Anki shrinks images to fit the screen by default. You can change this by adding
the following to the bottom of your styling section (outside of the default
<code>.card { ... }</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">img {
  max-width: none;
  max-height: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>AnkiDroid sometimes has <a href="https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3612">trouble scaling images to fit the
screen</a>. Setting maximum
image dimensions using css should fix this, but seems to be ignored as of
AnkiDroid 2.9. A fix is to append <code>!important</code> to each style directive, for
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">img {
  max-width: 300px !important;
  max-height: 300px !important;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to change the style for images and find that the star that
appears on marked cards is affected (for instance, it becomes way too
large), you can target it with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">img#star {
  ...;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can explore the styling of cards interactively by using Chrome:</p>
<p><a href="https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/porting2.0.html#webview-changes">https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/porting2.0.html#webview-changes</a></p>
<h2 id="field-styling"><a class="header" href="#field-styling">Field Styling</a></h2>
<p>The default styling applies to the whole card. You can also make certain
fields or part of the card use a different font, color, and so on. This
is particularly important when studying foreign languages, as Anki will
sometimes be unable to correctly display characters unless an
appropriate font has been chosen.</p>
<p>Say you have an “Expression” field, and you want to give it the OSX Thai
font “Ayuthaya”. Imagine your template already reads:</p>
<pre><code>What is {{Expression}}?

{{Notes}}
</code></pre>
<p>What we need to do is wrap the text we want to style in some HTML. We
will put the following in front of the text:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=mystyle1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And the following behind it:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By wrapping the text like the above, we tell Anki to style the wrapped
text with a custom style called “mystyle1”, which we will create later.</p>
<p>Thus if we wanted the entire “What is …​?” expression to use the Thai
font, we would use:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=mystyle1&gt;What is {{Expression}}?&lt;/div&gt;

{{Notes}}
</code></pre>
<p>And if we wanted only the expression field itself to use the Thai font,
we’d use:</p>
<pre><code>What is &lt;div class=mystyle1&gt;{{Expression}}&lt;/div&gt;?

{{Notes}}
</code></pre>
<p>After we’ve edited the template, we now need to move to the Styling
section between the templates. Before editing it, it should look
something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.card {
  font-family: arial;
  font-size: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  color: black;
  background-color: white;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Add your new style to the bottom, so it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.card {
  font-family: arial;
  font-size: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  color: black;
  background-color: white;
}

.mystyle1 {
  font-family: ayuthaya;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can include any styling you want in the style. If you wanted to
increase the font size too, you’d change the mystyle1 section to look
like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.mystyle1 {
  font-family: ayuthaya;
  font-size: 30px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s also possible to bundle custom fonts with your deck, so you don’t
need to install them on your computer or mobile device. Please see the
<a href="templates/styling.html#installing-fonts">installing fonts</a> section for more info.</p>
<h2 id="audio-replay-buttons"><a class="header" href="#audio-replay-buttons">Audio Replay Buttons</a></h2>
<p>When audio or text to speech is included on your cards, Anki will show
buttons you can click on to replay the audio.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to see the buttons, you can hide them in the
preferences screen.</p>
<p>You can customize their appearance in your card styling, for example, to
make them smaller and colored, you could use the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.replay-button svg {
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
}
.replay-button svg circle {
  fill: blue;
}
.replay-button svg path {
  stroke: white;
  fill: green;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="text-direction"><a class="header" href="#text-direction">Text Direction</a></h2>
<p>If you use a language that is written right-to-left, such as Arabic or Hebrew,
you can add the CSS <code>direction</code> property to the .card section for correct display during review:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.card {
  direction: rtl;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will change the direction of the entire card. You can change the direction
of only certain fields by wrapping their references in some HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;{{Front}}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To change the direction of fields in the editor, please see
the <a href="templates/../editing.html#customizing-fields">editing</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="other-html"><a class="header" href="#other-html">Other HTML</a></h2>
<p>Your templates can contain arbitrary HTML, which means that all the
layout possibilities used on internet web pages can also be used on your
cards. Things like tables, lists, images, links to external pages and so
on are all supported. With tables for example, you could change the
layout so that the front and back of a card appear on the left and right
instead of the top and bottom.</p>
<p>Covering all of HTML’s features is outside the scope of this manual, but
there are plenty of good introductory guides to HTML available on the
web if you’d like to learn more.</p>
<h2 id="browser-appearance"><a class="header" href="#browser-appearance">Browser Appearance</a></h2>
<p>If your card templates are complex, it may be difficult to read the
question and answer columns (called &quot;Front&quot; and &quot;Back&quot;) in the <a href="templates/../browsing.html#cardnote-table">card
list</a>. The &quot;browser appearance&quot; option allows you to define a
custom template to be used only in the browser, so you can include only
the important fields and change the order if you desire. The syntax is
the same as in standard card templates.</p>
<h2 id="platform-specific-css"><a class="header" href="#platform-specific-css">Platform-Specific CSS</a></h2>
<p>Anki defines some special CSS classes that allow you to define different
styling for different platforms. The example below shows how to vary the
font depending on where you’re reviewing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.win .jp {
  font-family: &quot;MS Mincho&quot;;
}
.mac .jp {
  font-family: &quot;Hiragino Mincho Pro&quot;;
}
.linux .jp {
  font-family: &quot;Kochi Mincho&quot;;
}
.mobile .jp {
  font-family: &quot;Hiragino Mincho ProN&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And in the template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=jp&gt;{{Field}}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For different iOS devices, you can use '.iphone' and '.ipad'.</p>
<p>You can also use properties like .gecko, .opera, and .ie to select
particular browsers when using AnkiWeb. Please see
<a href="http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/">http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/</a> for a full list of options.</p>
<h2 id="installing-fonts"><a class="header" href="#installing-fonts">Installing Fonts</a></h2>
<p>If you’re using Anki on a work or school computer where you don’t have
permission to install new fonts, or you’re using Anki on a mobile
device, it’s possible to add fonts directly to Anki.</p>
<p>To add a font to Anki, it must be in the TrueType format. TrueType fonts
have a filename ending in .ttf, such as &quot;Arial.ttf&quot;. Once you’ve located
a TrueType font, we’ll need to add it to the media folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rename the file, adding an underscore at the start, so it becomes
like &quot;_arial.ttf&quot;. Adding an underscore will tell Anki that this
file will be used on a template, and should not be deleted when
checking for unused media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your computer’s file browser, go to your <a href="templates/../files.html">Anki Folder</a>,
and then a folder called &quot;User 1&quot; (or your profile name if you’ve
renamed/added profiles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the folder, you should see a folder called collection.media.
Drag the renamed file to that folder.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, we need to update the template:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Add</strong> at the top of the main screen, and then select the
note type you want to change with the top left button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Cards</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the styling section, add the following text to the bottom (after
the last &quot;}&quot; character), replacing &quot;_arial.ttf&quot; with the name of
the file you copied into your media folder:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-css">@font-face {
  font-family: myfont;
  src: url(&quot;_arial.ttf&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Only change the &quot;arial&quot; part, not the &quot;myfont&quot; part.</p>
<p>After that, you can either change the font for the entire card, or for
individual fields. To change the font for the entire card, simply locate
the font-family: line in the .card section and change the font to
&quot;myfont&quot;. To change the font for only certain fields, please see the
<a href="templates/styling.html#field-styling">Field Styling</a> instructions above.</p>
<p>Please make sure the filenames match exactly. If the file is called
arial.TTF and you write arial.ttf in your card templates, it will not
work.</p>
<h2 id="night-mode"><a class="header" href="#night-mode">Night Mode</a></h2>
<p>You can customize the way templates appear when night mode is enabled in
the preferences screen.</p>
<p>If you wanted a lighter grey background, you could use
something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.card.nightMode {
  background-color: #555;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a 'myclass' style, the following would show the text in
yellow when night mode is enabled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.nightMode .myclass {
  color: yellow;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="fading-and-scrolling"><a class="header" href="#fading-and-scrolling">Fading and Scrolling</a></h2>
<p>Anki will automatically scroll to the answer by default. It looks for a
HTML element with id=answer, and scrolls to that. You can place the id
on a different element to adjust the scrolling position, or remove the
id=answer to turn off scrolling.</p>
<p>The question side of a card fades in by default. If you wish to adjust
this delay, you can place the following at the top of your front card
template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">    &lt;script&gt;qFade=100; if (typeof anki !== 'undefined') anki.qFade=qFade;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>100 (milliseconds) is the default; set to 0 to disable fading.</p>
<h2 id="javascript"><a class="header" href="#javascript">Javascript</a></h2>
<p>As Anki cards are treated like webpages, it is possible to embed some
Javascript on your cards via the card template. For a good reference
please read <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/card-templates-user-input-101-buttons-keyboard-shortcuts-etc-guide/13756">this post</a>
in the forums. </p>
<p>Because Javascript is an advanced feature and so many things can go
wrong, <strong>Javascript functionality is provided without any support or
warranty</strong>. We can not provide any assistance with writing Javascript,
and can not guarantee any code you have written will continue to work
without modification in future Anki updates. If you are not comfortable
addressing any issues you encounter on your own, then please avoid using
Javascript.</p>
<p>Each Anki client may implement card display differently, so you will
need to test the behaviour across platforms. A number of clients are
implemented by keeping a long running webpage and dynamically updating
parts of it as cards are reviewed, so your Javascript will need to
update sections of the document using things like
document.getElementById() rather than doing things like
document.write().</p>
<p>Functions like window.alert are also not available. Anki will write
javascript errors to the terminal, so if you’re running on a Mac or
Windows computer, you’ll need to manually catch the errors and write
them to the document to see them. There is no debugger available, so to
figure out problems you’ll need to break down your code until you
discover which parts are causing problems.</p>

<h2 id="basic"><a class="header" href="#basic">Basic</a></h2>
<p><strong>Video driver</strong><br />
Anki's libraries need a video driver to draw content on the screen.
Due to different hardware and software configurations, the driver that
works best on your machine may vary. ANGLE and OpenGL will perform better
than the software option, but they may not function correctly on some
systems. On Macs, you will almost always want to use the OpenGL option.</p>
<p><strong>Show play buttons</strong><br />
Whether a clickable (re)play button will be shown in the review screen
for cards with audio.</p>
<p><strong>Interrupt current audio</strong><br />
Whether a currently playing audio file should be stopped when answering
a card.</p>
<p><strong>Paste clipboard images as PNG</strong><br />
By default Anki pastes images on the clipboard as JPG files, to save disk space.
You can use the option to paste as PNG images instead. PNG images support
transparent backgrounds and are lossless, but they usually result in much larger
file sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Paste without Shift strips formatting</strong><br />
By default, formatting like bold and colors are kept when pasting,
unless the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is held down. This option reverses the behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Night mode</strong><br />
Night mode will cause Anki to show cards as white text on a
black background. Some card templates may need to be modified to work
properly with this option enabled - please see <a href="templates/styling.html#night-mode">night mode
styling</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>When adding, default to current deck</strong><br />
Controls how note types and decks interact. The default of &quot;When adding, default
to current deck&quot; means that Anki saves the last-used note type for each deck and
selects it again then next time you choose the deck (and, in addition, will
start with the current deck selected when choosing Add from anywhere). The other
option, &quot;Change deck depending on note type,&quot; saves the last-used deck for each
note type (and opens the add window to the last-used note type when you choose
Add). This may be more convenient if you always use a single note type for each
deck.</p>
<p><strong>Default search text</strong>
Allows you to customize the starting search text in the browser (eg, to start 
with &quot;deck:current&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>User interface size</strong>
If you find that the interface elements are too small for you, you can 
try to increase this setting.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling"><a class="header" href="#scheduling">Scheduling</a></h2>
<p><strong>Show next review time above answer buttons</strong><br />
Useful to know how far in the future your cards are being pushed.</p>
<p><strong>Show remaining card count during review</strong><br />
Disable this option to hide the card count at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Show learning cards with larger steps before</strong><br />
Only shown when the 2.1 scheduler is enabled. Normally learning cards with a 1+
day delay are shown after normal reviews. If checked, Anki will show them before
normal reviews instead.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy timezone handling</strong><br />
Please see here:
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/timezone-handling-changes.html">https://faqs.ankiweb.net/timezone-handling-changes.html</a></p>
<p><strong>V3 Scheduler</strong><br />
The Anki V3 scheduler is documented here:<br />
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Mix new cards and reviews</strong>:
Only shown when the v1/v2 schedulers are enabled. This drop-down box controls when
new cards are shown: either mixed with, before, or after all reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Next day starts at</strong><br />
Controls when Anki should start showing the next day’s cards. The default
setting of 4AM ensures that if you’re studying around midnight, you won’t have
two days' worth of cards shown to you in one session. If you stay up very late
or wake up very early, you may want to adjust this to a time you’re usually
sleeping. Note that the start of the next day is relative to your current timezone.
Also note that any cards that cross a day boundary <a href="./deck-options.html#day-boundaries">will appear at the start of 
the day they are scheduled for</a>, just like review cards do. </p>
<p><strong>Learn ahead limit</strong><br />
Tells Anki how to behave when there is nothing left to study in the current deck
but cards in learning. The default setting of 20 minutes tells Anki that cards
should be shown early if they have a delay of less than 20 minutes and there’s
nothing else to do. If you set this to 0, Anki will always wait the full delay,
showing the congratulations screen until the remaining cards are ready to be
reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Timebox time limit</strong><br />
Timeboxing is a technique to help you focus by dividing a longer activity (such
as a 30 minute study session) into smaller blocks. If you set the timebox time
limit to a non-zero number of minutes, Anki will periodically show you how many
cards you’ve managed to study during the prescribed time limit.</p>
<h2 id="network"><a class="header" href="#network">Network</a></h2>
<p>The network tab contains options related to syncing with AnkiWeb.</p>
<ul>
<li>When logged in, the <strong>deauthorize</strong> button will log you out.</li>
<li>When the 'force changes' option is enabled, the next sync will
ask you whether you wish to upload or download. This is useful if
you have made some changes accidentally, and wish to overwrite them
with an older version that is on AnkiWeb.</li>

<p>Deck options primarily control the way Anki schedules cards. It is recommended
that you spend a few weeks with the defaults to get a feel for how Anki works
before you start adjusting options. Please make sure you understand the options
before changing them, as mistakes could reduce Anki's effectiveness.</p>
<p>Deck options are accessed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking the gear icon on the <code>Decks</code> screen.</li>
<li>Selecting a deck on the <code>Decks</code> screen, and then clicking <code>Options</code>
at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Clicking on <code>More</code> &gt; <code>Options</code> while in review mode.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>o</code> while in review mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This page describes the options shown in Anki 2.1.45+, when you have the v2 or
v3 scheduler enabled. On older versions, some options will not be available, or
will appear in a different section.</p>
<h2 id="presets"><a class="header" href="#presets">Presets</a></h2>
<p>Anki allows you to share options between different decks, to make
updating options in many decks at once easy. To do this, options are
grouped into <em>presets</em>. By default, all newly created decks use
the same preset.</p>
<p>If you’d like to alter the settings on one deck but not other decks, click the
arrow icon in the top right of the Deck Options window. The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save</strong>: Saves all modifications you've made since opening the deck options screen.</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong>: Add a new preset, with the default options.</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong>: Clone your current present, which is useful if you
just want to modify certain options, keeping the rest as they are.</li>
<li><strong>Rename</strong>  Changes the name of the current preset.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> Deletes the current preset. This will require that the next sync is
a one-way sync.</li>
<li><strong>Save to all subdecks</strong>. Like <em>Save</em>, but also assigns the selected preset to all
subdecks of the currently selected deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deck Options are not retroactive. For example, if you change an option that
controls the delay after failing a card, cards that you failed prior to
changing the option will have the old delay, not the new one.</p>
<h2 id="subdecks"><a class="header" href="#subdecks">Subdecks</a></h2>
<p>If your deck has subdecks, each deck can optionally be assigned a different preset.
When Anki shows a card, it will check which subdeck the card is in, and use the options
for that deck. There are some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new cards/day and reviews/day <a href="deck-options.html#daily-limits">limits</a> behave differently
depending on the scheduler version you have selected.</li>
<li>The <a href="deck-options.html#display-order">display order</a> options in the v3 scheduler are taken from the
deck you select to study, not the deck of the current card.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's say you have this collection:</p>
<pre><code>- Deck A (Preset 1)
  - Deck A::Subdeck B (Preset 2)
    - Card B1
    - Card B2
</code></pre>
<p>Preset 1 and 2 are identical, with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preset 1:
<ul>
<li>New Cards - Learning steps: 1m 10m</li>
<li>Display Order - New/review priority: Mix with reviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preset 2:
<ul>
<li>New Cards - Learning steps: 20m 2h</li>
<li>Display Order - New/review priority: Show after reviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to study Deck A:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning steps for all new cards will be 20m 2h (preset 2 applies)</li>
<li>All new cards will be mixed with reviews (preset 1 applies)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to study Subdeck B:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning steps for all new cards will be 20m 2h (preset 2 applies)</li>
<li>All new cards will be shown after reviews (preset 2 applies)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="daily-limits"><a class="header" href="#daily-limits">Daily Limits</a></h2>
<h3 id="new-cardsday"><a class="header" href="#new-cardsday">New Cards/Day</a></h3>
<p>Controls how many new cards are introduced each day you open the program. If you
study fewer than the limit, or miss a day, the next day the counts will be back
to your limit - they do not accumulate.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">the v3 scheduler</a>, Anki
uses the limits of the deck you select as an upper limit on the number of cards.
This means if &quot;French&quot; has a limit of 20 cards and &quot;French::Lesson 1&quot; and
&quot;French::Lesson 2&quot; both have limits of 15 cards, when you click on &quot;French&quot;,
you’ll get at most 15 cards from either child deck, and only 20 cards in total.</p>
<p>In the v1 or v2 scheduler, each parent applies its limits to its children. If you
have decks in a grandparent-parent-child arrangement, both the grandparent and
parent limits will alter how many cards are shown from the child, even if you
click directly on the child. In the v3 scheduler, this has been simplified, and 
now each deck's limit controls how many cards from that specific deck can be used.
Imagine that you have this collection:</p>
<pre><code>- Parent deck (New Cards/Day: 20) 
  - Child deck (New Cards/Day: 7)
    - Grandchild deck A (New Cards/Day: 5)
      - Cards 1 to 50
    - Grandchild deck B (New Cards/Day: 5) 
      - Cards 51 to 100
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If you click on the Parent deck, you will get 10 new cards (from Grandchild decks A and B).</li>
<li>If you click on the Child deck, you will get 7 new cards (from Grandchild decks A and B).</li>
<li>If you click on any of the Grandchild decks, you will get 5 new cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studying new cards will temporarily increase the number of reviews you need to
do a day, as freshly learnt material needs to be repeated a number of times
before the delay between repetitions can increase appreciably. If you are
consistently learning 20 new cards a day, you can expect your daily reviews to
be roughly about 200 cards/day. You can decrease the reviews required by
introducing fewer new cards each day, or by turning off new card display until
your review burden decreases. More than one Anki user has excitedly studied
hundreds of new cards over their first few days of using the program, and then
become overwhelmed by the reviews required.</p>
<p>If using <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">the v3 scheduler</a>,
please keep in mind that the new count is capped by the review count. If your
review limit is set to 200, and you have 190 reviews waiting, a maximum of 10
new cards will be introduced. If your review limit has been reached, no new
cards will be shown. If you have a backlog of reviews and still want to
introduce new cards, you can do so by suspending the reviews, or increasing your
review limit. That said, it is recommended you hold off on new cards until you
catch up instead, as introducing more new cards when you're behind will only
make the backlog worse.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-reviewsday"><a class="header" href="#maximum-reviewsday">Maximum Reviews/Day</a></h3>
<p>Allows you to set an upper limit on the number of reviews to show each day.
When this limit is reached, Anki will not show any more review cards for the
day, even if there are some waiting. If you study consistently, this setting can
help to smooth out occasional peaks in due card counts, and can save you from a
heart attack when returning to Anki after a week off. When reviews have been
hidden due to this option, a message will appear in the congratulations screen,
suggesting you consider increasing the limit if you have time.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">the v3 scheduler</a> and
v1 schedulers, the counts are affected by parents/selected decks in the same way
as new cards.</p>
<p>In the v2 scheduler, the limit is taken solely from the deck you select - any
limits on its parents or child decks are ignored.</p>
<p>The v3 scheduler includes learning cards with a 1+ day delay in the review count,
so those learning cards will be subject to the daily limit.</p>
<h2 id="new-cards"><a class="header" href="#new-cards">New Cards</a></h2>
<p>The settings in this section only affect new cards and cards in initial
<a href="studying.html#learningrelearning-cards">learning</a> mode. Once a card
has graduated (i.e. there are no more learning steps for this card), it  becomes a
<a href="studying.html#review-cards">review card</a>, and the
settings in this section are no longer applicable.</p>
<h3 id="learning-steps"><a class="header" href="#learning-steps">Learning Steps</a></h3>
<p>Controls the number of learning repetitions, and the delay
between them. One or more delays, separated by spaces must be entered.
Each time you press <code>Good</code> during review, the card moves to the next step.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that your learning steps are <strong>1m 10m 1d</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you press <code>Again</code>, the card goes back to first step, and will be shown
again approximately 1 minute later.</li>
<li>When you press <code>Good</code> on a new card, or a card answered <code>Again</code>, it will move
to the next step, and be shown again in approximately 10 minutes.</li>
<li>When you press <code>Good</code> on a card after the 10 minute step, it will be delayed
until the next day.</li>
<li>When you press <code>Good</code> on the card the next day, it will leave learning (i.e. it will graduate), and
become a review card. It will be shown again after the delay configured by the
<em>graduating interval</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s nothing else to study, Anki will show cards up to 20 minutes
early by default. The amount of time to look ahead is configurable in
the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="studying.html#learningrelearning-cards">learning</a> section for more info on how
steps work. Also, check <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/deck-options-explained/213">this forum's
post</a> for more
examples.</p>
<h4 id="day-boundaries"><a class="header" href="#day-boundaries">Day Boundaries</a></h4>
<p>Anki treats small steps and steps that <a href="./preferences.html#scheduling">cross a day boundary</a> differently.
With small steps, the cards are shown as soon as the delay has passed,
in preference to other waiting cards like reviews. This is done so that
you can answer the card as closely to your requested delay as possible.
In contrast, if the interval crosses a day boundary, it is automatically 
converted to days.</p>
<h3 id="graduating-interval"><a class="header" href="#graduating-interval">Graduating Interval</a></h3>
<p>The delay in days between answering &quot;Good&quot; on a learning card with no steps left,
and seeing the card again as a review card. Please see the example in the
previous section.</p>
<h3 id="easy-interval"><a class="header" href="#easy-interval">Easy Interval</a></h3>
<p>The delay between answering <code>Easy</code> on a learning
card, and seeing it in review mode for the first time.</p>
<p>The <code>Easy</code> button immediately turns a learning card into a review card,
and assigns it the delay you have configured. It should always be at least
as long as the <em>graduating interval</em>, and typically a few days longer.</p>
<h3 id="insertion-order"><a class="header" href="#insertion-order">Insertion Order</a></h3>
<p>Controls whether Anki should add new cards into the deck randomly, or in order.
When you change this option, Anki will re-sort the decks using the current
Option Group.  Cards with a lower due number will be shown first when studying, by
default. Changing this option will automatically update the existing position of
new cards.</p>
<p>One caveat with random order mode: if you review many of your new cards, and then
add more new cards, the newly added material is statistically more likely to
appear than the new cards that were already in the deck. For example, if you have 100 cards
in random order, then review the first 50, newly added cards are still given
position 1-100, but as you have already reviewed the first 50, the newly added
cards are more likely to appear earlier. To correct this, you can change the
order to Ordered mode and back again to force a re-sort.</p>
<p>When you select random order, Anki will randomize your notes, keeping
the cards of a given note close together. The cards of a given note are
shown in the order, in which their card types appear, so that siblings are
introduced consistently — otherwise you could end up in a state where
some notes had all their cards introduced and other notes had only one
or two. Please see the &quot;bury related&quot; and &quot;display order&quot; sections below
for more info.</p>
<h2 id="lapses"><a class="header" href="#lapses">Lapses</a></h2>
<p>When you forget a review card, it is said to have 'lapsed', and the card must be
relearnt. The default behaviour for lapsed reviews is to reset the interval to
1 (i.e. make it due tomorrow), and put it in the learning queue for a refresher
in 10 minutes. This behaviour can be customized with the options listed below.</p>
<h3 id="relearning-steps"><a class="header" href="#relearning-steps">Relearning Steps</a></h3>
<p>The same as 'learning steps', but for forgotten reviews. When you fail a card
(press <code>Again</code>), the card enters the relearning phase, and before it becomes a
review card again, you will have to pass all the relearning steps — or, alternatively, press
<code>Easy</code> on the card.</p>
<p>If you leave the steps blank, the card will skip relearning, and will be assigned
a new review delay.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-interval"><a class="header" href="#minimum-interval">Minimum Interval</a></h3>
<p>Specifies a minimum number of days a card should wait after it finishes relearning.
The default is one day, meaning once relearning is finished, it will be shown again
the next day.</p>
<h3 id="leeches"><a class="header" href="#leeches">Leeches</a></h3>
<p>Control the way Anki handles leeches. Please see the <a href="leeches.html">leeches</a>
section for more information.</p>
<h2 id="timer"><a class="header" href="#timer">Timer</a></h2>
<p>Anki monitors how long it takes you to answer each question, so that it
can show you how long was spent studying each day. The time taken does
not influence scheduling. The default limit is 60 seconds. If you take
longer than that, Anki assumes you have walked away from your computer
or have been distracted, and limits the recorded time to 60 seconds, so
that you don’t end up with inaccurate statistics. If you consistently
take longer than 60 seconds to answer a card, you may want to either
consider raising this limit, or ideally, making your cards simpler.</p>
<h2 id="burying"><a class="header" href="#burying">Burying</a></h2>
<p>Please see <a href="./studying.html#siblings-and-burying">this section</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="display-order-1"><a class="header" href="#display-order-1">Display Order</a></h2>
<p>The options in this section are taken from the deck you select to study, not
the deck of the currently displayed card.</p>
<p>This section is only available when you have <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">the v3
scheduler</a> enabled.</p>
<p>Some further information about display order is available in the <a href="studying.html#display-order">studying
section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-card-gather-priority"><a class="header" href="#new-card-gather-priority">New Card Gather Priority</a></h3>
<p>Controls how Anki gathers cards from each subdeck.</p>
<p>With the default <code>Deck</code> ordering, cards are gathered from each subdeck in order,
stopping when the limit of the selected deck has been exceeded. This is faster,
and allows you to priorize subdecks that are closer to the top. Decks / subdecks
are always ordered alphabetically, so you can give them a numeric prefix like
001 to control the order they are shown. You can also use <code>_</code> and <code>~</code> as a
prefix to place items at the top or bottom.</p>
<p>Although position order depends initially on the 'Insertion Order' setting
above, you can manually
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/browsing.html#cards">reposition</a> cards in different
ways.</p>
<h3 id="new-card-sort-order"><a class="header" href="#new-card-sort-order">New Card Sort Order</a></h3>
<p>Controls how cards are sorted <strong>after they have been gathered</strong>.
By default, Anki sorts by template first, to avoid multiple cards of the
same note from being shown in succession. This results in cards appearing
in the order they have been added, with the first card template (eg front-&gt;back)
appearing before later card templates (eg back-&gt;front).</p>
<h3 id="newreview-priority"><a class="header" href="#newreview-priority">New/Review Priority</a></h3>
<p>Whether new cards should be mixed in with reviews, or shown before or after them.</p>
<h3 id="interday-learningreview-priority"><a class="header" href="#interday-learningreview-priority">Interday Learning/Review Priority</a></h3>
<p>Whether learning cards with a 1+ day delay should be mixed in with reviews, or
shown before or after them. Because learning cards tend to be harder than
reviews, some users prefer to see them at the end (getting the easy stuff done
first), or at the start (allowing more time to review forgotten ones).</p>
<h3 id="review-sort-order"><a class="header" href="#review-sort-order">Review Sort Order</a></h3>
<p>The default order prioritizes cards that have been waiting longer, which works
well when you are up to date, or when you only have a small backlog. If you have taken an
extended break or have fallen behind in your reviews, you may want to consider
changing the sort order temporarily. Sorting by ascending intervals will ensure
cards with shorter delays are shown first, and by descending intervals will allow
you to work through the easier material first.</p>
<p>Choosing the <em>Deck, then due date</em> option will ensure reviews are shown for each
subdeck in turn. This is generally not recommended, as having material appear
consistently in the same order makes it easier to guess the answer based on context,
and may lead to weaker memories.</p>
<h2 id="audio"><a class="header" href="#audio">Audio</a></h2>
<p>By default, Anki automatically plays audio on the front and back of
cards. If you uncheck 'automatically play audio', Anki will not play
audio until you press the replay audio key, <code>r</code> or <code>F5</code>.</p>
<p><em>Always include question side when replaying audio</em> controls whether audio from
the question side should be played when replaying the audio while an answer is
shown. Please note that it does not control what happens when you show the
answer; for that please see <a href="templates/fields.html#special-fields">this section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advanced"><a class="header" href="#advanced">Advanced</a></h2>
<h3 id="maximum-interval"><a class="header" href="#maximum-interval">Maximum Interval</a></h3>
<p>Allows you to place an upper limit on the time Anki
will wait to reshow a card. The default is 100 years; you can decrease
this to a smaller number if you’re willing to trade extra study time for
higher retention.</p>
<h3 id="starting-ease"><a class="header" href="#starting-ease">Starting Ease</a></h3>
<p>Controls the easiness that cards start out with. It is
set when a card graduates from learning for the first time. It defaults
to 2.50, meaning that once you have finished learning a card, answering
<code>Good</code> on subsequent reviews will increase the delay by approximately
2.5x (e.g. if the last delay was 10 days, the next delay would be around 25
days). Based upon how you rate the card in subsequent reviews, the
easiness may increase or decrease from its starting value.</p>
<h3 id="easy-bonus"><a class="header" href="#easy-bonus">Easy Bonus</a></h3>
<p>An extra multiplier applied to the interval when a review card is answered
<code>Easy</code>. With the default value of 1.30, <code>Easy</code> will give an interval that is
1.3 times the <code>Good</code> interval (e.g. if the last interval was 10 days, the next 
interval would be around 13 days).</p>
<h3 id="interval-modifier"><a class="header" href="#interval-modifier">Interval Modifier</a></h3>
<p>An extra multiplier that is applied to all reviews. At its default of 1.00 it
does nothing. If you set it to 0.80, though, for example, intervals will be generated at
80% of their normal size (so a 10 day interval would become 8 days). You can
thus use the multiplier to make Anki present cards more or less frequently than
it would otherwise, trading study time for retention or vice versa.</p>
<p>For moderately difficult material, the average user should find they
remember approximately 90% of mature cards that come up for review. You
can find out your own performance by opening the graphs/statistics for a
deck and looking at the Answer Buttons graph - mature retention is the
correct% on the right side of the graph. If you haven’t been studying
long, you may not have any mature cards yet. As performance with new
cards and younger cards can vary considerably, it’s a good idea to wait
until you have a reasonable amount of mature reviews before you start
drawing conclusions about your retention rate.</p>
<p>On the SuperMemo website, they suggest that you can find an appropriate
multiplier for a desired retention rate. Their formula boils down to:</p>
<pre><code>log(desired retention%) / log(current retention%)
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine we have a current retention rate of 85% and we want to increase
it to 90%. We’d calculate the modifier as:</p>
<pre><code>log(90%) / log(85%) = 0.65
</code></pre>
<p>You can use Google to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=log(90%25)+%2F+log(85%25)">calculate
it</a> for you.</p>
<p>If you plug the resulting 65% into the interval modifier, you should
find over time that your retention moves closer to your desired
retention.</p>
<p>One important thing to note however is that the trade-off between time
spent studying and retention is not linear: we can see here that to
increase our retention by 5 percentage points, we would have to study 35%
more frequently. If the material you are learning is very important then
it may be worth the extra effort – that is, of course, something you will need to
decide for yourself. If you are simply worried that you are forgetting too
much, then you may find investing more time at the initial learning stage
and/or using mnemonics will give you more gain for less effort.</p>
<p>One final thing to note is that Anki forces a new interval to be at
least 1 day longer than it was previously, so that you do not get stuck
reviewing with the same interval forever. If your goal is to repeat a
card once a day for multiple days, you can do that by setting more
learning mode steps, instead of by adjusting this modifier.</p>
<h3 id="hard-interval"><a class="header" href="#hard-interval">Hard Interval</a></h3>
<p>The multiplier used when you use the <code>Hard</code> button. The percentage is relative
to the previous interval: e.g. with a default of 1.20, a card with a 10-day interval
will be given 12 days.</p>
<h3 id="new-interval"><a class="header" href="#new-interval">New Interval</a></h3>
<p>The multiplier used when you use the <code>Again</code> button on a review card. The
default 0.00 means that a review card's delay is reset to zero when you forget it
(which then becomes 1 day after the <a href="deck-options.html#minimum-interval">minimum interval</a> is
applied).</p>
<p>If changed from the default, it is possible for forgotten cards to preserve part
of their previous delay. For example, if a card had a 100 day interval, and you set
the <em>New Interval</em> to 0.20, the new interval would be 20 days.</p>
<p>While preserving part of the interval may seem to make sense, SuperMemo has observed
that preserving part of the delay can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Post-lapse_stability">be counter-productive</a>. For this reason, we recommend you leave it on the default setting.</p>

<p>AnkiWeb is a service that allows you to keep your collection
synchronized across multiple devices, and to study online. Please sign
up for a <a href="https://ankiweb.net/">free account</a> before following the steps
below.</p>
<h2 id="intro-videos"><a class="header" href="#intro-videos">Intro Videos</a></h2>
<p>For a quick introduction to syncing, please check out the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkiM4DPzSVc&amp;list=PLGgmaKOIHykFoomqkBJAyGiDQ2kyiuTao&amp;yt:cc=on">syncing intro videos</a>.</p>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h2>
<p>To start syncing your collection across devices, click the sync button
(the top right one on the main screen), or press 'y' on your keyboard.
You’ll be prompted for your AnkiWeb ID and password, which you created
in the signup process.</p>
<p>When you synchronize your collection for the first time, Anki will ask
you if you want to upload or download. If you have cards on your
computer and your AnkiWeb account is empty, choose &quot;upload&quot; to send your
data to AnkiWeb. If you have cards on AnkiWeb from another device, and
no cards on your computer, choose &quot;download&quot; to replace the empty local
collection with the cards that are on AnkiWeb. If you have different
cards on both devices, <a href="syncing.html#merging-conflicts">more work is required</a> to
avoid losing data.</p>
<p>Once the initial one way sync is completed, Anki will be able to merge
changes from multiple locations with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>If you have multiple people using Anki on one machine and have created a
profile for each user, each user will need to create their own AnkiWeb
account to sync with. If you attempt to synchronize multiple profiles
with a single AnkiWeb account, you will lose data.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-syncing"><a class="header" href="#automatic-syncing">Automatic Syncing</a></h2>
<p>Once syncing is enabled, Anki will automatically sync each time your
collection is closed or opened. If you would prefer to synchronize
manually, you can disable automatic syncing in Anki’s preferences.</p>
<h2 id="button-color"><a class="header" href="#button-color">Button Color</a></h2>
<p>The sync button will change to blue when a normal sync is required,
and red when a full sync is required.</p>
<h2 id="media"><a class="header" href="#media">Media</a></h2>
<p>Related video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phP9GGG-PxY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phP9GGG-PxY</a></p>
<p>Anki will synchronize any sounds and images used by your notes. It will
notice when media has been added or removed from your media folder, but
will not notice if you have edited some existing files without adding or
removing any. To get your edits noticed, you need to add or remove a
file as well.</p>
<p>If you’re running Anki off a USB flash drive, you should use an NTFS
file system, as Anki may not be able to detect media changes on a FAT32
filesystem.</p>
<h2 id="conflicts"><a class="header" href="#conflicts">Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>Related video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEAcpfMQnjo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEAcpfMQnjo</a></p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, reviews and note edits can be merged, so if
you review or edit on two different devices before syncing, Anki will
preserve your changes from both locations. If the same card has been
reviewed in two different locations, both reviews will be marked in the
revision history, and the card will be kept in the state it was when it
was most recently answered.</p>
<p>There are certain changes that Anki is unable to merge. These mainly
relate to the format of notes: things like adding a new field, or
removing a card template. When you perform an operation that can’t be
merged, Anki will warn you, and give you the option of aborting the
operation. If you choose to continue, you’ll be asked to choose whether
to keep the local copy or the copy on AnkiWeb when your collection is
next synchronized.</p>
<p>If certain problems are detected while syncing, it will also force a one
way sync. If you find this consistently happens, please post on our
support site.</p>
<p>When a one way sync is required, you need to choose whether you wish to
keep the collection on your local device, or the collection on AnkiWeb.
If changes have been made on both ends, only changes on one end can be
preserved.</p>
<p>If you choose Upload, the content on your local device will be sent to
AnkiWeb. You then need to sync your other devices, and choose &quot;Download&quot;
to have them grab a copy of that content.</p>
<p>If you choose Download, it will replace any local changes you’ve made
with the data that is on AnkiWeb.</p>
<p>Once all devices are in sync, future syncs will return to the normal
behaviour of merging changes from both ends.</p>
<p>If you wish to force a full upload or download (for example, because you
accidentally deleted a deck on one side and want to restore the deck
rather than having its deletion synchronized), you can check the &quot;On
next sync, force changes in one direction&quot; box in
Tools&gt;Preferences&gt;Network, then sync as usual. (You’ll be given
the option to choose which side you want to use.)</p>
<p>Forcing a one way sync only affects card syncing - media is synced as
normal. If you have files that you want to remove from AnkiWeb, please
ensure your client is fully in sync first. After syncing is up to date,
any files you remove (eg via the Check Media function) will be removed
from AnkiWeb on the following sync.</p>
<h2 id="merging-conflicts"><a class="header" href="#merging-conflicts">Merging Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>Because the <a href="syncing.html#setup">first sync</a> can only sync changes in one
direction, if you have added different content to different devices or
profiles before setting syncing up, content on one device will be lost
if you overwrite it with the content from the other device. With some
work, it is possible to manually merge data into a single collection.</p>
<p>Start by taking a backup on each device/profile, in case something goes
wrong. With the computer version you can use File&gt;Export to export
&quot;all decks&quot; with scheduling information and media files included, and
save the file somewhere safe. In AnkiMobile, the Add/Export button on
the decks list screen will let you export all decks with media.</p>
<p>Next, if one of your devices is a mobile device, synchronize it first.
If there’s a conflict, choose &quot;upload&quot; to overwrite any existing data on
AnkiWeb with the data from your mobile device. If both devices/profiles
are on your computer, synchronize the device/profile with the most
number of decks first.</p>
<p>Now return to the other device/profile. If automatic syncing is enabled,
a message may pop up asking if you want to upload or download. Click the
cancel button - we don’t want to sync yet.</p>
<p>Once you’re looking at the deck list, click the cog icon next to the
first deck, and choose &quot;export&quot;. Export the content with scheduling
information and media included, and save the .apkg file somewhere. Now
you’ll need to repeat this for each top-level deck.</p>
<p>Once all top-level decks have been exported, click the sync button at
the top right, and choose &quot;download&quot;, which will overwrite the local
content with the content you synced from your other device.</p>
<p>You can now use File&gt;Import to import the .apkg files you exported
earlier, which will merge the exported content with the existing
content, so everything will be in one place.</p>
<h2 id="firewalls"><a class="header" href="#firewalls">Firewalls</a></h2>
<p>Anki needs to be able to make outbound HTTPS connections to sync. At a
minimum it must be able to connect to ankiweb.net, sync.ankiweb.net and
syncN.ankiweb.net, where N is number between 2 and 6. These domains may
change over time, and the IP addresses they point to may also change, so
we recommend you allow wildcard access to *.ankiweb.net to reduce the
chance of the firewall rules needing to be updated in the future.</p>
<p>If you have a firewall on your machine, you should add an exception for
Anki. If you are on a work or school network, please contact your
network administrator for assistance - it is not something we can help
you with.</p>
<h2 id="proxies"><a class="header" href="#proxies">Proxies</a></h2>
<p>If you need a proxy to access the internet, Anki should automatically
pick up your system proxy settings if you’re on Windows or macOS, and
will honour the HTTP_PROXY environment variable if you’re on another
platform.</p>
<p>Anki will only be able to pick up your system settings if a proxy is
manually configured, and does not require a password. If your system
uses automatic proxy setup, or uses a proxy that requires a username and
password, you will need to manually tell Anki the proxy configuration.</p>
<p>To tell Anki your proxy settings, define a HTTPS_PROXY environmental
variable that points to the proxy server. It will look like:</p>
<pre><code>http://user:pass@proxy.company.com:8080
</code></pre>
<p>If your username or password contains an @ (eg <code>user@workdomain.com</code>),
you need to change it to %40, like so:</p>
<pre><code>http://user%40workdomain.com:pass@proxy.company.com:8080
</code></pre>
<p>Anki 2.0 expects to find HTTP_PROXY instead of HTTPS_PROXY.</p>
<p>To set environmental variables on Windows, please see
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+set+environmental+variable">https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+set+environmental+variable</a></p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac, please see
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x</a></p>
<p>Heavily locked down networks that intercept secure connections and
present their own certificate instead may cause Anki to throw up SSL
errors. In such environments, you may be able to work around the errors
with <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/878367706">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/878367706</a></p>
<p>An alternative solution is to install a local proxy server, and point
that proxy server at your normal proxy server. You can then tell Anki to
use the local proxy, which will redirect requests to the proxy you
normally use.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="profiles"><a class="header" href="#profiles">Profiles</a></h1>
<p>If more than one person wants to use Anki on your computer, you can set
up a separate profile for each user. Each user profile has their own
collection, and own program settings. Add-ons are shared across profiles.
Profiles are configured by going to the File menu and choosing &quot;Switch Profile&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Only a single profile can be synced to an AnkiWeb account.</strong>
If you have different users on your computer, each user will
need to set up a separate AnkiWeb account for their profile. If you attempt
to link two or more profiles to the same AnkiWeb account, you will overwrite
the data from one profile with the data from the other.</p>
<p>Profiles are primarily intended to be used by different people, and are not
recommended for splitting up your own content.
If you have created multiple profiles for yourself, the best option is to
merge them into a single profile. You can do so by exporting one deck from
profile A, and then importing it into profile B, repeating for any other decks
in profile A, until everything is in profile B.</p>
<p>AnkiDroid does not support profiles.</p>
<h2 id="profiles-window"><a class="header" href="#profiles-window">Profiles window</a></h2>
<p>From the Profiles window (accessible via File&gt;Switch Profile from the main window), you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open / Add / Rename / Delete user profiles. </li>
<li>Quit the program.</li>
<li>Restore an <a href="./files.html#backups">automatic backup.</a></li>
<li>Downgrade your collection, which is necessary if you want to open it with
an earlier Anki release. If you skip this step, you may get an error message 
when opening your collection in an older Anki version, and you will need to 
return to this version, downgrade, then try again.</li>

<p>The Browse window allows you to search through your cards and notes, and edit
them. It is opened by clicking <strong>Browse</strong> in the main window, or by pressing
<kbd>B</kbd>. It is comprised of three sections: the <em>sidebar</em> on the
left, the <em>card/note table</em> on the top right, and the <em>editing area</em> on the bottom
right. By positioning the mouse between two sections, it is possible to click
and drag to expand one section and shrink the other.</p>
<h2 id="table-modes"><a class="header" href="#table-modes">Table Modes</a></h2>
<p>Anki 2.1.45+ offers two modes: either cards or notes are shown in the data table.
You can change the current mode by clicking the switch at the top, to the left
of the search area, or pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>. The switch also
indicates if <strong>C</strong>ards or <strong>N</strong>otes are currently shown.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For the sake of simplicity, this manual generally assumes the Cards
mode to be the active one. Whenever &quot;cards&quot; is mentioned while selecting, finding, etc.,
the reader may substitute it for “notes&quot;, depending on the active mode.</p>
<h2 id="sidebar"><a class="header" href="#sidebar">Sidebar</a></h2>
<p>The <em>sidebar</em> on the left allows quick access to common search terms. On Anki
2.1.45+, it also provides a searchbar, facilities to edit tags and decks, and a
choice of two different tools, which are discussed in the following sections.
You can switch tools using the toolbar at the top of the sidebar or the shortcuts
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>/<kbd>2</kbd>.</p>
<h3 id="search-tool"><a class="header" href="#search-tool">Search Tool</a></h3>
<p>With this tool, the sidebar behaves as in previous versions: Clicking on an item
will search for it.</p>
<p>You can hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (<kbd>Command</kbd> on Mac) while clicking in
order to append the clicked item to the current search with an AND condition,
instead of starting a new search. If you wanted to show <em>learning</em> cards that were
also in the German deck for instance, you could click on &quot;Learning&quot;,
then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-click on &quot;German&quot;.</p>
<p>You can hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> to create an OR search instead of an AND. For
example, you could click one deck, then <kbd>Shift</kbd>-click another to show
cards from either of the decks in the same view.</p>
<p>You can hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> (<kbd>Option</kbd> on Mac) in order to reverse the
search (prepend a <code>-</code>): for example, to show all cards in a current deck that
do <em>not</em> have a certain tag. <kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Option</kbd> can be combined with
either <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> (e.g. clicking <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd></p>
<p>will result in adding a new search term that is negated).</p>
<p>On Anki 2.1.39+, you can also hold down both <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and
<kbd>Shift</kbd> together when clicking a search term to replace all occurrences of the
same kind of search with the new one.
Let's say you had previously typed in a complicated search expression like
<code>deck:Swahili (is:due or tag:important)</code>
and now want to perform the same search for your Urdu deck. You can hold
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> while clicking the Urdu deck in the sidebar to obtain the
following search expression:
<code>deck:Urdu (is:due or tag:important)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="selection-tool"><a class="header" href="#selection-tool">Selection Tool</a></h3>
<p>The Selection tool allows for selecting multiple items at the same time by holding down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-
and <kbd>Shift</kbd> together, while clicking. It also enables drag-and-drop to reorder decks and
tags.</p>
<p>Here is an example: Say you have the tags <code>Math</code>, <code>Calculus</code>, and <code>Algebra</code>.
Click on the <code>Calculus</code> tag, then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-click on the <code>Algebra</code> tag. Now both
tags are selected, click and drag any of the two onto the <code>Math</code> tag to make them
both children of this tag. Behind the scene, Anki has renamed the two tags to
<code>Math::Calculus</code> and <code>Math::Algebra</code> respectively and updated your notes accordingly.</p>
<p>Another use case for selecting multiple items is searching: If you right-click on
a selection of items, you can choose <strong>Search &gt; All/Any Selected Items</strong>. This
can be combined with keyboard modifiers as described in <a href="browsing.html#search-tool">Search Tool</a>
to append the resulting search to the current search.</p>
<h3 id="saved-searches"><a class="header" href="#saved-searches">Saved Searches</a></h3>
<p>If you regularly search for the same thing,
you can save the current search by right-clicking the topmost item in the sidebar,
choosing “Save Current Search” and typing in a name.</p>
<h3 id="editing-items"><a class="header" href="#editing-items">Editing Items</a></h3>
<p>You can delete or rename tags, decks, and saved searches directly from the sidebar,
from the right-click menu, or by using a shortcut key (<kbd>Del</kbd> and
<kbd>F2</kbd> on Windows). Deletion even works for multiple items at once
(see <a href="browsing.html#selection-tool">Selection Tool</a>).</p>
<h3 id="finding-items"><a class="header" href="#finding-items">Finding Items</a></h3>
<p>To find a certain item in the sidebar tree, type part of its name into the searchbar
at the top to temporarily hide all items not matching the search.</p>
<h2 id="search-box"><a class="header" href="#search-box">Search Box</a></h2>
<p>Above the card list is a search box. You can type in various things
there to search for cards. For information on the search syntax,
see <a href="searching.html">Searching</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cardnote-table"><a class="header" href="#cardnote-table">Card/Note Table</a></h2>
<p>The table's rows represent cards or notes that match the current search.
When you click on a row, the corresponding note will be shown in the bottom section.</p>
<h3 id="rows"><a class="header" href="#rows">Rows</a></h3>
<p>If you drag the mouse or hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd> to select multiple
rows, the editor will be temporarily hidden. Various operations (such as
changing the deck) can operate on multiple cards or notes at once, independent
of the active mode. Therefore in Cards mode, a note is considered to be selected
if any of its cards is selected, and in Notes mode, a card is considered to be selected
if its note is selected.</p>
<p>Other operations (like showing card information) only operate on a single card — the so-called
<em>current</em>, card or note, which is usually the one that was last selected or clicked.
In Cards Mode, again, the current note is the note of the current card and in Notes
mode, the current card is the first card of the current note.</p>
<p>The background colour will change depending on the card and note. In Cards mode,
the first match will be used:</p>
<ol>
<li>if the card is flagged, use the flag colour,</li>
<li>if the card is suspended, yellow,</li>
<li>if the card's note is marked, purple.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Notes mode, colour is only applied to marked notes.<br />
For more information about marked notes and suspended cards, see <a href="studying.html#editing-and-more">Editing and
More</a>.</p>
<h3 id="columns"><a class="header" href="#columns">Columns</a></h3>
<p>The columns are configurable: right click on one (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-click on a
Mac) to choose which columns you'd like to see.
You can drag columns to reorder them. Clicking on a column will sort by that column;
click again to reverse the sort order. Note that you cannot sort by the Question
and Answer columns.</p>
<p>All columns are available for both <a href="browsing.html#table-modes">Cards and Notes mode</a>
but sometimes with slightly different names and data. The following table lists
the behaviours for both modes.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<table><thead><tr><th>Column</th><th>Cards mode</th><th>Notes mode</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Answer</td><td>The back side of the card in one line with the question stripped. You can also choose a <a href="templates/styling.html#browser-appearance">custom format</a> in the card type editor instead.</td><td>The same as in Cards mode, only for the first card of the note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Card(s)</td><td>The name of the card's template.</td><td>The number of cards the note has.</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
<h2 id="editing-area"><a class="header" href="#editing-area">Editing Area</a></h2>
<p>The bottom right area displays the note of the currently selected row. For
more information about cards and notes, see <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>.
For more information on formatting buttons, see <a href="editing.html">Editing</a>.</p>
<p>You can see a preview of what the currently selected card would look
like when reviewing by clicking the <strong>Preview</strong> button next to the search
box. Note that this will not display any type-the-answer fields on your
cards, which makes it easier to preview the cards quickly.
In Notes mode, the preview is shown for the first card of the selected note.</p>
<h2 id="menus-and-actions"><a class="header" href="#menus-and-actions">Menus and Actions</a></h2>
<p>At the top of the browser window, you find a toolbar with various menus which in

</tbody></table>
<h3 id="notes"><a class="header" href="#notes">Notes</a></h3>
<p>Most of the following actions operate on the selected notes. They are also available through
a context menu when a selected row is right-clicked in Notes mode. In Cards mode,
they can be found in a submenu of the context menu.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td>Clear Unused Tags</td><td>Remove all tags from the sidebar that are not used by any notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toggle Mark</td><td>If the current note is marked (i.e., has the <em>Marked</em> tag), unmark all selected notes. If the current is not marked, mark all selected notes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Change Notetype</td><td>Convert the selected notes from one type to another. For example, imagine you have a <em>Russian</em> notetype and a <em>Computer</em> notetype, and you accidentally added some computer-related text into a <em>Russian</em> note. You can use this option to fix that mistake. The scheduling of cards is not affected. Changing the type of a note requires a one-way sync.</td></tr>

<h3 id="cards-1"><a class="header" href="#cards-1">Cards</a></h3>
<p>The following actions operate on the currently selected cards. They are also available through
a context menu when a selected row is rightclicked in Cards mode. In Notes mode,
they can be found in a submenu of the context menu.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Change Deck</td><td>Move currently selected cards to a different deck.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set Due Date</td><td>Turn cards into review cards, and make them due on a certain date. This can be useful for moving cards forward or back a few days when your study schedule is interrupted. Entering a range like <code>60-90</code> will give cards an interval between 60 and 90 days, which can be useful when you've imported a bunch of material you already know.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Forget</td><td>Move currently selected cards to the end of the new queue. The existing review history is preserved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reposition</td><td>Change the order new cards will appear in. You can find out the existing positions by enabling the <em>due</em> column, as described in the <a href="browsing.html#cardnote-table">table</a> section above. If you run the reposition command when multiple cards are selected, it will apply increasing numbers to each card in turn. By default the number increases by one for each card, but this can be adjusted by changing the &quot;step&quot; setting. The <strong>Shift position of existing cards</strong> option allows you to insert cards between currently existing ones, pushing the currently existing ones apart. For instance, if you have five cards and you want to move 3, 4, and 5 between 1 and 2, selecting this setting would cause the cards to end up in the order 1, 3, 4, 5, 2. By contrast, if you turn this option off, 1 and 2 will get the same position number (and it will thus be unpredictable which of the cards with the same number comes up first). Please note that when enabled, any card with a higher position will be modified, and all of those changed cards will need to be sent the next time you sync.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toggle Suspend</td><td><a href="studying.html#editing-and-more">Suspend</a> or unsuspend all selected cards, depending on whether the current card is suspended or not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flag</td><td>Toggle the flags of all selected cards. Whether a flag is added or removed depends on whether the current card has the chosen flag.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Info</td><td>Show various information about the current card, including its review history. For more information, see <a href="stats.html#card-info">Card Info</a>.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id="go"><a class="header" href="#go">Go</a></h3>
<p>This menu exists to provide keyboard shortcuts to jump to various
parts of the browser, and to go up and down the card list.</p>
<h2 id="find-and-replace"><a class="header" href="#find-and-replace">Find and Replace</a></h2>
<p>To replace text in selected notes, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right click on selected notes in the <em>card list</em>, and click <strong>Find and Replace</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Browser</strong> window, click <strong>Notes</strong> in the menu bar and click <strong>Find and Replace</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular expression option allows you to perform complex replacements.
For example, given the following text in a field:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;pic.jpg&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Searching for:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;(.+?)&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and on Anki 2.1.28, replacing with:</p>
<pre><code>${1}
</code></pre>
<p>on older Anki versions, replacing with:</p>
<pre><code>\1
</code></pre>
<p>Will change the card to:</p>
<pre><code>pic.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>A full discussion on regular expressions is outside the scope of this document.
There are a number of syntax guides available on the web:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Anki 2.1.28+, see <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.9/regex/#syntax">https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.9/regex/#syntax</a>.</li>
<li>For older Anki versions, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html">http://docs.python.org/library/re.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-duplicates"><a class="header" href="#finding-duplicates">Finding Duplicates</a></h2>
<p>You can use the <strong>Notes &gt; Find Duplicates</strong> option to search for notes that
have the same content. When you open the window, Anki will look at all
of your note types and present a list of all possible fields. If you
want to look for duplicates in the <em>Back</em> field, you’d select it from
the list and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
<p>By default, it will search in all note types that have the field you provided.
This differs from the duplicate check when you add cards manually, which
is limited to a single note type.</p>
<p>The <strong>Optional filter</strong> text box allows you to narrow down where Anki will
look for duplicates. If you only want to search for duplicates in the
&quot;French Vocab&quot; and &quot;French Verbs&quot; note types, you would enter:</p>
<pre><code>note:'french vocab' or note:'french verbs'
</code></pre>
<p>Or you might want to look only for duplicates in a particular deck, so
you could use:</p>
<pre><code>deck:'myDeck'
</code></pre>
<p>The search syntax is the same as used when searching in the browser.
For more information, see <a href="searching.html">Searching</a>.</p>
<p>You can click one of the links in the search results list to display the
duplicate notes in that set. If the search brings up a large number of
duplicates, you may wish to instead click the <strong>Tag Duplicates</strong> button,
which will tag all matching notes with <em>duplicate</em>. You can then search
for this tag in the browser and handle them all from the same screen.</p>

</ul>
<p>When you study a regular deck in Anki, only a limited number of cards
are shown: the cards Anki thinks you are about to forget, and a daily
limit of new cards. This is generally useful, as it ensures you don't
spend more time studying than necessary. But sometimes it can be useful
to step outside of these normal limits, such as when you need to review
for a test, focus on particular material, and so on. To make this
possible, Anki provides a different type of deck called a 'filtered
deck'.</p>
<p>Filtered decks offer a lot of possibilities. They can be used for
previewing cards, cramming cards before a test, studying particular
tags, catching up on a backlog with a particular sort order, reviewing
ahead of schedule, going over the day's failed cards, and more.</p>
<h2 id="custom-study"><a class="header" href="#custom-study">Custom Study</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to create a filtered deck is with the Custom Study
button, which appears at the bottom of the screen when you click on a
deck. It offers some convenient preset filters for common tasks like reviewing
the cards that you have failed that day. It will create a filtered deck called
&quot;Custom Study Session&quot; and automatically open it for you.</p>
<p>If an existing &quot;Custom Study Session&quot; deck exists, it will be emptied
before a new one is created. If you wish to keep a custom study deck,
you can rename it from the deck list.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of each of the options:</p>
<p><strong>Increase today's new card limit</strong><br />
Add more new cards to the deck you are currently studying. Note that
unlike other options, this does 'not' create a new filtered deck, it
modifies the existing deck.</p>
<p><strong>Increase today's review card limit</strong><br />
If not all reviews due today were shown because of the daily review limit,
this option allows you to show more of them. As with the new cards
option, this modifies the existing deck.</p>
<p><strong>Review forgotten cards</strong><br />
Show all the cards, for which you've answered Again (1) within the number of days
you specify.</p>
<p><strong>Review ahead</strong><br />
Show cards that will be due in the near future (the number of days you
specify). This is useful for working through some of your older cards
before a vacation, but it will not help with cards you have learnt
recently. Please see the <a href="filtered-decks.html#reviewing-ahead">reviewing ahead</a> section
below for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Preview new cards</strong><br />
Show cards that you have recently added, without converting them to
review cards as they are answered.</p>
<p><strong>Study by card state or tag</strong><br />
Select a certain number of cards from the current deck to study. You can
choose to select new cards only, due cards only, or all cards; after you
click &quot;Choose Tags&quot;, you can also limit the selected cards by tags. If
you wish to see all the cards in the deck (for instance, to study before
a big test), you can set the number of cards to more than the number of
cards in the deck.</p>
<h2 id="home-decks"><a class="header" href="#home-decks">Home Decks</a></h2>
<p>When a card is moved to a filtered deck, it retains a link to the deck,
from which it came. That previous deck is said to be the card's 'home
deck'.</p>
<p>Cards automatically return to their home deck after they are studied in
the filtered deck. This can be after a single review, or after multiple
reviews, depending on your settings.</p>
<p>It is also possible to move all cards back to their home decks at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The &quot;Empty&quot; button in the study overview moves all cards in the
filtered deck back to their home deck, but does not delete the empty
filtered deck. This can be useful if you want to fill it again later
(using the Rebuild button).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleting a filtered deck does the same thing as &quot;Empty&quot; does, but
also removes the emptied deck from the deck list. No cards are
deleted when you delete a filtered deck.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the old scheduler, if you create, rebuild, empty, or delete a
filtered deck while cards are still in learning, they will be turned
back into new cards. In the case of failed reviews in relearning, any
remaining relearning steps will be skipped. This was fixed in the
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">v2
scheduler</a> so cards
are no longer reset.</p>
<h2 id="creating-manually"><a class="header" href="#creating-manually">Creating Manually</a></h2>
<p>Advanced users can create filtered decks with arbitrary search strings
(or 'filters'),
instead of relying on the preset filters. To create a filtered deck manually,
choose Create Filtered Deck from the Tools menu.</p>
<p>When you click the Build button, Anki finds cards that match the
settings you specified, and temporarily moves them from their existing
decks into your new filtered deck for study.</p>
<p>If you wish to fetch cards again using the same filter options (for
instance, if you want to study all cards with a particular tag every
day), you can use the Rebuild button at the bottom of the deck's
overview screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>search</strong> area controls what cards Anki will gather. All of the
searches possible in the browser are also possible for filtered decks,
such as limiting to tags, finding cards forgotten a certain number of
times, and so on. Please see the <a href="searching.html">searching</a> section of the
manual for more information on the different possibilities.</p>
<p>Filtered decks cannot pull in cards that are suspended, buried, or already in a
different filtered deck. And if you are using the v1 scheduler, cards in
(re)learning will not be included either. For this reason, a search in the
browser may reveal cards that do not end up in the filtered deck.</p>
<p>The <strong>limit</strong> option controls how many cards will be gathered into the
deck. The order you select controls both the order cards are gathered
in, and the order they will be reviewed in. If you select &quot;most lapses&quot;
and a limit of 20 for example, then Anki will show you only the 20 most
lapsed cards.</p>
<h2 id="order"><a class="header" href="#order">Order</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;cards selected by&quot; option controls the order that cards will appear
in. If the maximum number of cards you select is lower than the number
of cards that match the filter criteria, Anki will exclude the cards at
the end of this sorted list first.</p>
<p><strong>Oldest seen first</strong><br />
Display those cards first, that you haven't seen in reviews for the longest
time.</p>
<p><strong>Random</strong><br />
Randomize the order of all cards that match the filter criteria (use no
set order).</p>
<p><strong>Increasing intervals</strong><br />
Display cards that have the smallest interval first.</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing intervals</strong><br />
Display cards that have the largest interval first.</p>
<p><strong>Most lapses</strong><br />
Display those cards first, that you have failed the most times.</p>
<p><strong>Order added</strong><br />
Display cards that you added first (i.e. those cards that have the earliest
creation date).</p>
<p><strong>Order due</strong><br />
Display cards with the earliest due date first.</p>
<p><strong>Latest added first</strong><br />
Display those cards first, that you have most recently added to the deck.
(This is the opposite of 'Order added'.)</p>
<p><strong>Relative overdueness</strong><br />
Display those cards first, that are most overdue in relation to their current
interval (for instance, a card with a current interval of 5 days
overdue by 2 days displays before a card with a current interval of 5
years overdue by a week). This is useful if you have a large backlog
that may take some time to get through and you want to review those cards
first, that you are most in danger of forgetting.</p>
<h2 id="steps--returning"><a class="header" href="#steps--returning">Steps &amp; Returning</a></h2>
<p>Please see the section on <a href="studying.html#learningrelearning-cards">learning</a> as a reminder of how
steps work.</p>
<p>By default, Anki will use the steps of a card’s home deck. If a new card
would normally be reviewed twice when being learnt, the same thing will
happen when you study it in a filtered deck.</p>
<p>Cards return to their home deck when (re)learning is complete. Thus if
you have 3 learning steps, a new card will return to its home deck upon
three presses of &quot;Good&quot; or a single press of &quot;Easy&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>v1 and v2 scheduler</strong></p>
<p>In the v1 scheduler, the <strong>custom steps</strong> option allows you to override the
home deck’s steps and provide your own steps instead. The provided steps apply to both
cards being learnt, lapsed reviews, and reviews ahead of time. Please note, however, that
from the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">v2 scheduler</a>
filtered decks <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/filtered-deck-interval-problem/11834/8">no longer support custom steps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>v3 scheduler</strong></p>
<p>Filtered decks with rescheduling disabled show 4 buttons in the 
<a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">v3 scheduler</a> - the provided
delay applies to the Again button, and Hard/Good will use 1.5x and 2x the 
provided delay. Easy will remove the card.</p>
<h2 id="counts"><a class="header" href="#counts">Counts</a></h2>
<p>In a filtered deck, reviews that were already due are displayed in the
review count as normal. Learning cards and non-due reviews are counted
in the new card count, due to how the underlying implementation works.
Reviews that were not due are not scheduled like new cards however:
Anki uses a special algorithm that takes into account how close they
were to their normal due time when reviewed.</p>
<h2 id="due-reviews"><a class="header" href="#due-reviews">Due Reviews</a></h2>
<p>If the filtered deck includes cards that were due for review, they will
be shown like they would have been in their original deck: they appear
in the review card count at the bottom of the screen, and there are four
choices for how well you remembered. Upon a correct answer, the card
will be moved back to its home deck, and its next delay adjusted using
the home deck's settings. If you forget the card, it will be shown
according to the relearning steps defined in the home deck.</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-ahead"><a class="header" href="#reviewing-ahead">Reviewing Ahead</a></h2>
<p>If your search included cards that are not due, Anki will show the
reviews ahead of time.</p>
<p>Anki uses a special algorithm for these reviews that takes into account
how early you are reviewing. If the cards were almost due to be shown,
they will be given a new delay similar to what they would have received
if you had reviewed them on time. If the cards are reviewed soon after
they were scheduled however, their new delay will be similar to their
previous delay. This calculation works on a sliding scale.</p>
<p>Because reviewing a card shortly after it is scheduled has little impact
on scheduling (e.g. a card due tomorrow with a one day interval will
remain due tomorrow if reviewed early), <strong>the &quot;review ahead&quot; custom
study setting is not appropriate for repeated use</strong>. If used to go
through a week's worth of cards before a trip, the mature cards will be
rescheduled into the future and the new cards will remain at small
intervals, because you don't know them well enough for them to be
rescheduled further. If you review ahead again the next day, all you'll
end up doing is going through those same new cards again, to little
benefit.</p>
<p>Early reviews are included in the new card count rather than the review
count, and will be shown according to the number of relearning steps
defined in the home deck (unless you have provided custom steps). This
means that if you have customized the number of relearning steps in the
home deck, the non-due card may be shown more than once.</p>
<p>If you have multiple steps, Anki will only consider the first answer
when deciding the next delay, and like relearning in normal decks,
&quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Easy&quot; differ only in the step change and not the resulting
delay.</p>
<h2 id="rescheduling"><a class="header" href="#rescheduling">Rescheduling</a></h2>
<p>By default, Anki will return cards to their home decks with altered scheduling,
based on your performance in the filtered deck. There is a <strong>reschedule
cards based on my answers</strong> option available which alters this behaviour.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-anki-2.1-scheduler.html">v2 scheduler</a>,
when rescheduling is disabled, cards are shown in a simple &quot;preview mode&quot;, and
when they are returned to the original deck, they are returned exactly as they
started.</p>
<p>In the v1 scheduler, cards were presented more similarly to how they normally
are, but studying cards had side effects, and the original position of new cards
was lost when you studied them.</p>
<h2 id="catching-up"><a class="header" href="#catching-up">Catching Up</a></h2>
<p>Filtered decks can be useful for catching up when you've fallen behind
in your reviews. One Anki user describes the way they use the filtered
decks to catch up as follows:</p>
<pre><code>I did this for a backlog of 800 cards with filtered subdecks. Worked
very well for me.

Just Due filter with: &quot;is:due prop:due&gt;-7&quot;

Over Due filter with: &quot;is:due prop:due&lt;=-7&quot;

The Just Due deck will then contain cards that became due in the past
week. That's the deck you should study every day as it gets the cards
that become due regularly. With this you can study as if there weren't
any backlog.

The Over Due deck will contain your backlog — cards which you didn't
study in time. You can study them the same way you would study new
cards. They go back into the regular cards, so the number of overdue
will never grow as long as you keep your Just Due deck in check.

How long it takes depends on how many overdue cards you study each day
in addition to the ones that become due regularly. You can still motor
through them when you feel like it - or you can do a specific number per
day like you would for new cards. Up to you.

<p>Anki's Browse screen and the Filtered Deck feature use a common method
of searching for specific cards/notes.</p>
<h2 id="simple-searches"><a class="header" href="#simple-searches">Simple searches</a></h2>
<p>When you type some text into the search box, Anki finds matching notes
and displays their cards. Anki searches in all fields of the notes, but
does not search for tags (see later in this section for how to search
for tags). Some examples:</p>
<p><code>dog</code><br />
search for &quot;dog&quot; - will match words like &quot;doggy&quot; and &quot;underdog&quot; too.</p>
<p><code>dog cat</code><br />
finds notes that have both &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;cat&quot; on them, such as &quot;raining
cats and dogs&quot;.</p>
<p><code>dog or cat</code><br />
finds notes with either &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
<p><code>dog (cat or mouse)</code><br />
finds notes with dog and cat, or dog and mouse.</p>
<p><code>-cat</code><br />
finds notes without the word &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
<p><code>-cat -mouse</code><br />
finds notes with neither &quot;cat&quot; nor &quot;mouse&quot;.</p>
<p><code>-(cat or mouse)</code><br />
same as the above.</p>
<p><code>&quot;a dog&quot;</code><br />
finds notes with the exact sequence of characters &quot;a dog&quot; on them, such
as &quot;atta dog&quot;, but not &quot;dog a&quot; or &quot;adog&quot;.</p>
<p><code>-&quot;a dog&quot;</code><br />
finds notes without the exact phrase &quot;a dog&quot;</p>
<p><code>d_g</code><br />
finds notes with d, &lt;a letter&gt;, g, like dog, dig, dug, and so on.</p>
<p><code>d*g</code><br />
finds notes with d, &lt;zero or more letters&gt;, g, like dg, dog, dung,
etc.</p>
<p><code>w:dog</code><br />
search for &quot;dog&quot; on a word boundary - will match &quot;dog&quot;, but not &quot;doggy&quot;
or &quot;underdog&quot;. Requires Anki 2.1.24+ or AnkiMobile 2.1.61+.</p>
<p><code>w:dog*</code><br />
will match &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;doggy&quot;, but not &quot;underdog&quot;.</p>
<p><code>w:*dog</code><br />
will match &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;underdog&quot;, but not &quot;doggy&quot;.</p>
<p>Things to note from the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search terms are separated by spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When multiple search terms are provided, Anki looks for notes that
match all of the terms - an implicit 'and' is inserted between each
term. On Anki 2.1.24+ and AnkiMobile 2.0.60+ you can be explicit
if you like (&quot;dog and cat&quot; is the same as &quot;dog cat&quot;), but older
Anki versions will treat &quot;and&quot; as just another word to search for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use &quot;or&quot; if you only need one of the terms to match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can prepend a minus sign to a term to find notes that don’t
match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can group search terms by placing them in parentheses, as in the
<strong>dog (cat or mouse)</strong> example. This becomes important when
combining OR and AND searches — in the example, with the
parentheses, it matches either 'dog cat' or 'dog mouse', whereas
without them it would match either 'dog and cat' or 'mouse'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anki is only able to search within formatting in the <a href="editing.html#customizing-fields">sort
field</a> you’ve configured. For example, if you add
&quot;<strong>exa</strong>mple&quot; to one of your fields, this will not be matched when
searching for &quot;example&quot; unless that field is the sort field. If a
word is not formatted, or the formatting does not change in the
middle of the word, then Anki will be able to find it in any field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard searches are case insensitive for Latin characters - a-z will
match A-Z, and vice versa. Other characters such as Cyrillic are case sensitive
in a standard search, but can be made case insensitive by searching on a word
boundary or regular expression (w:, re:).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limiting-to-a-field"><a class="header" href="#limiting-to-a-field">Limiting to a field</a></h2>
<p>You can also ask Anki to match only if a particular field contains some
text. Unlike the searches above, searching on fields requires an 'exact
match' by default.</p>
<p><code>front:dog</code><br />
find notes with a Front field of exactly &quot;dog&quot;. A field that says &quot;a
dog&quot; will not match.</p>
<p><code>front:*dog*</code><br />
find notes with Front field containing dog somewhere</p>
<p><code>front:</code><br />
find notes that have an empty Front field</p>
<p><code>front:_*</code><br />
find notes that have a non-empty Front field</p>
<p><code>front:*</code><br />
find notes that have a Front field, empty or not</p>
<p><code>fr*:text</code>
find notes in a field starting with &quot;fr&quot;. Requires Anki 2.1.24+ or AnkiMobile 2.1.60+.</p>
<h2 id="tags-decks-cards-and-notes"><a class="header" href="#tags-decks-cards-and-notes">Tags, decks, cards and notes</a></h2>
<p><code>tag:animal</code><br />
find notes with the tag &quot;animal&quot;</p>
<p><code>tag:none</code><br />
find notes with no tags</p>
<p><code>tag:ani*</code><br />
find notes with tags starting with ani</p>
<p><code>deck:french</code><br />
find cards in a French deck, or subdecks like French::Vocab</p>
<p><code>deck:french -deck:french::*</code><br />
find cards in French, but not subdecks</p>
<p><code>deck:&quot;french vocab&quot;</code><br />
searching when a deck has a space</p>
<p><code>&quot;deck:french vocab&quot;</code><br />
also ok</p>
<p><code>deck:filtered</code><br />
filtered decks only</p>
<p><code>-deck:filtered</code><br />
normal decks only</p>
<p><code>card:forward</code><br />
search for Forward cards</p>
<p><code>card:1</code><br />
search for cards by template number - eg, to find the second cloze
deletion for a note, you’d use card:2</p>
<p><code>note:basic</code><br />
search for cards with a Basic note type</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-accentscombining-characters"><a class="header" href="#ignoring-accentscombining-characters">Ignoring accents/combining characters</a></h2>
<p>Requires Anki 2.1.24+ or AnkiMobile 2.0.60+.</p>
<p>You can use <code>nc:</code> to remove combining characters (&quot;no combining&quot;). For example:</p>
<p><code>nc:uber</code><br />
matches notes with &quot;uber&quot;, &quot;über&quot;, &quot;Über&quot; and so on.</p>
<p><code>nc:は</code><br />
matches &quot;は&quot;, &quot;ば&quot;, and &quot;ぱ&quot;</p>
<p>Searches that ignore combining characters are slower than regular searches.</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions"><a class="header" href="#regular-expressions">Regular expressions</a></h2>
<p>Anki 2.1.24+ and AnkiMobile 2.0.60+ support searching in notes with &quot;regular expressions&quot;,
a standard and powerful way of searching in text.</p>
<p>Start a search with <code>re:</code> to search by regular expression. To make things easier, Anki will
treat the following as <a href="searching.html#raw-input">raw input</a>, so bear in mind the rules listed there.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p><code>&quot;re:(some|another).*thing&quot;</code><br />
find notes that have &quot;some&quot; or &quot;another&quot; on them, followed by 0 or more characters, and then &quot;thing&quot;</p>
<p><code>re:\d{3}</code><br />
find notes that have 3 digits in a row</p>
<p>Regular expressions can also be limited to a specific field. Please note that unlike the normal searches
in a specific field, regular expressions in fields don't require an exact match. Eg:</p>
<p><code>front:re:[a-c]1</code><br />
matches uppercase or lowercase a1, B1 or c1 that occurs anywhere in the &quot;Front&quot; field</p>
<p><code>front:re:^[a-c]1$</code><br />
like the above, but will not match if any other text falls before or after a1/b1/c1.</p>
<p>You can learn more about regular expressions here: <a href="https://regexone.com/lesson/introduction_abcs">https://regexone.com/lesson/introduction_abcs</a></p>
<p>Some things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The search is case-insensitive by default; use (?-i) at the start to turn on case sensitivity.</li>
<li>Some text like spaces and newlines may be represented differently in HTML - you can
use the HTML editor in the editing screen to see the underlying HTML contents.</li>
<li>For the specifics of Anki's regex support, please see the regex crate documentation: <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.9/regex/#syntax">https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.9/regex/#syntax</a></li>

<h2 id="matching-special-characters"><a class="header" href="#matching-special-characters">Matching special characters</a></h2>
<p>This section was written for Anki 2.1.36+ - earlier versions did not support escaping
characters in certain situations.</p>
<p>As shown in the previous section, some characters like <code>*</code>, <code>_</code> and <code>&quot;</code> have a
special meaning in Anki. If you need to locate those characters in a search,
you need to tell Anki not to treat them specially.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Space</em><br />
To match something including spaces, enclose the <code>&quot;entire term&quot;</code> in double
quotes. If it is a colon search, you also have the option to only quote the
<code>part:&quot;after the colon&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&quot;</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>_</code><br />
Add a backslash before these characters to treat them literally. For example,
<code>_</code> will match any single character, but <code>\_</code> matches only an actual underscore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>\</code><br />
Because a backlash is used to remove the special meaning from other characters,
it too is treated specially. If you need to search for an actual backslash,
use <code>\\</code> instead of <code>\</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(</code> and <code>)</code><br />
You can search for parentheses either by enclosing the full term in quotes,
and/or by using a backslash. That is, <code>&quot;some(text)&quot;</code>, <code>some\(text\)</code> and
<code>&quot;some\(text\)&quot;</code> are all equivalent, but <code>some(text)</code> is not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-</code><br />
Starting a search term with <code>-</code> usually inverts it: <code>-dog</code> matches everything
except dog for example. If you instead wish to include an actual hyphen,
you can either use a backslash, or include the text in quotes, such as
<code>\-.-</code> or <code>&quot;-.-&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>:</code><br />
Colons have to be escaped unless they are preceded by another, unescaped colon.
So <code>w:e:b</code> is a word boundary search for <code>e:b</code>, <code>w\:e\:b</code> searches literally for
<code>w:e:b</code> and <code>w\:e:b</code> searches the field <code>w:e</code> for <code>b</code> (see
<a href="searching.html#limiting-to-a-field">field searches</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raw-input"><a class="header" href="#raw-input">Raw input</a></h3>
<p>Text preceded by certain keywords (like <code>re:</code>) will be treated as raw input. That is,
the charcters listed above largely lose their special meaning. In such a context, only
a minimum of escaping is required to prevent ambiguity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>&quot;</code> must be escaped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spaces and unescaped parentheses require the search term to be quoted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The search term must not end in an odd number of backslashes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Anki can import text files, packaged Anki decks created by the export
feature, Mnemosyne 2.0 .db files, and SuperMemo .xml files. To import a
file, click the File menu and then &quot;Import&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="text-files"><a class="header" href="#text-files">Text Files</a></h2>
<p>Any <strong>plain text</strong> file that contains fields separated by commas,
semicolons or tabs can be imported into Anki, provided some conditions
are met.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The files must be plain text (myfile.txt). Other formats like
myfile.xls, myfile.rtf, myfile.doc must be saved as a plain text
file first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The files must be in UTF-8 format (see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anki determines the number of fields in the file by looking at the
first (non-commented) line. Any lines in the file which have a
different number of fields will be ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first line also defines the separating character – if Anki finds
a ';' on the first line it will use that, if it finds a comma it’ll
use that, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fields in your text file can be mapped to any field in your notes,
including the tags field. You can choose which field in the text file
corresponds to which field in the note when you import.</p>
<p>When you import a text file, you can choose what deck to put the cards
in. Keep in mind that if you have the deck override option set for one
or more of your templates, the cards will go to that deck rather than
the one you’ve selected.</p>
<p>This is an example of a valid file:</p>
<pre><code>foo bar; bar baz; baz quux
apple; banana; grape
</code></pre>
<p>There are two ways to include newlines in fields.</p>
<p><strong>Escape the multi-lines by placing the contents of the field in
quotation marks</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>hello; &quot;this is
a two line answer&quot;
two; this is a one line one
</code></pre>
<p>Because quotes are used to mark where a field begins and ends, if you
wish to include them inside your field, you need to replace a single
doublequote with two doublequotes to &quot;escape&quot; them from the regular
handling, like so:</p>
<pre><code>field one;&quot;field two with &quot;&quot;escaped quotes&quot;&quot; inside it&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>When you use a spreadsheet program like Libreoffice to create the CSV
file for you, it will automatically take care of escaping double quotes.</p>
<p><strong>Use HTML new lines</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>hello; this is&lt;br&gt;a two line answer
two; this is a one line one
</code></pre>
<p>You need to turn on the &quot;allow HTML in fields&quot; checkbox in the import
dialog for HTML newlines to work.</p>
<p>Escaped multi-lines will not work correctly if you are using cloze
deletions that span multiple lines. In this case, please use HTML
newlines instead.</p>
<p>You can also include tags in another field and select it as a tags field
in the import dialog:</p>
<pre><code>first field; second field; tags
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of a valid file where the first line is ignored (#):</p>
<pre><code># this is a comment and is ignored
foo bar; bar baz; baz quux
field1; field2; field3
</code></pre>
<h3 id="spreadsheets-and-utf-8"><a class="header" href="#spreadsheets-and-utf-8">Spreadsheets and UTF-8</a></h3>
<p>If you have non-Latin characters in your file (such as accents, Japanese
and so on), Anki expects files to be saved in a 'UTF-8 encoding'. The
easiest way to do this is to use the free LibreOffice spreadsheet
program instead of Excel to edit your file, as it supports UTF-8 easily,
and also exports multi-line content properly, unlike Excel. If you wish
to keep using Excel, please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12YE_FS6A9ANLTESJNtPP116ti4nNmCBghyoJBRtno_k/edit?usp=sharing">this forum
post</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>To save your spreadsheet to a file Anki can read with LibreOffice, go to
File&gt;Save As, and then select CSV for the type of file. After
accepting the default options, LibreOffice will save the file and you
can then import the saved file into Anki.</p>
<h3 id="html"><a class="header" href="#html">HTML</a></h3>
<p>Anki can treat text imported from text files as HTML (the language used
for web pages). This means that text with bold, italics and other
formatting can be exported to a text file and imported again. If you
want to include HTML formatting, you can check the &quot;allow HTML in
fields&quot; checkbox when importing. You may wish to turn this off if you’re
trying to import cards whose content contains angle brackets or other
HTML syntax.</p>
<p>If you wish to use HTML for formatting your file but also wish to
include angle brackets or ampersands, you may use the following replacements:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Character</th><th>Replacement</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>&lt;</td><td><code>&amp;lt;</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;</td><td><code>&amp;gt;</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;</td><td><code>&amp;amp;</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3 id="importing-media"><a class="header" href="#importing-media">Importing Media</a></h3>
<p>If you want to include audio and pictures from a text file import, copy
the files into the <a href="files.html">collection.media folder</a>. <strong>Do not put
subdirectories in the media folder, or some features will not work.</strong></p>
<p>After you’ve copied the files, change one of the fields in your text
file as follows.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;myimage.jpg&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>[sound:myaudio.mp3]
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="browsing.html">find and replace</a> feature
in the browse screen to update all the fields at once. If each field
contains text like &quot;myaudio&quot;, and you wish to make it play a sound,
you’d search for (.*) and replace it with &quot;[sound:\1.mp3]&quot;, with the
'regular expressions' option enabled.</p>
<p>When importing a text file with these references, you must make sure to
enable the &quot;Allow HTML&quot; option.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to do this in a template, like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;{{field name}}&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Anki doesn’t support this for two reasons: searching for used media is
expensive, as each card has to be rendered, and such functionality isn’t
obvious to shared deck users. Please use the find &amp; replace technique
instead.</p>
<h3 id="bulk-media"><a class="header" href="#bulk-media">Bulk Media</a></h3>
<p>Another option for importing large amounts of media at once is to use
the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1531997860">media import add-on</a>.
This add-on will automatically create notes for all files in a folder
you select, with the filenames on the front (minus the file extension,
so if you have a file named apple.jpg, the front would say 'apple') and
the images or audio on the back. If you would like a different
arrangement of media and filenames, you can <a href="browsing.html">change the note
type</a> of the created cards afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="adding-tags"><a class="header" href="#adding-tags">Adding Tags</a></h3>
<p>If you want to add 'tag1' and 'tag2' to every line you’re importing, add
the following to the top of the text file:</p>
<pre><code>tags:tag1 tag2
</code></pre>
<h3 id="duplicates-and-updating"><a class="header" href="#duplicates-and-updating">Duplicates and Updating</a></h3>
<p>When importing text files, Anki uses the first field to determine if a
note is unique. By default, if the file you are importing has a first
field that matches one of the existing notes in your collection and that
existing note is the same type as the type you’re importing, the
existing note’s other fields will be updated based on content of the
imported file. A drop-down box in the import screen allows you to change
this behaviour, to either ignore duplicates completely, or import them
as new notes instead of updating existing ones.</p>
<p>The duplicate check is done for your 'entire collection', not just in
the current deck. If Anki is indicating that notes have not changed when
you expected them to be imported, please check that the notes are not
already in your collection somewhere.</p>
<p>If you have updating turned on and older versions of the notes you’re
importing are already in your collection, they will be updated in place
(in their current decks) rather than being moved to the deck you have
set in the import dialog. If notes are updated in place, the existing
scheduling information on all their cards will be preserved.</p>
<p>For info on how duplicates are handled in .apkg files, please see the
<a href="exporting.html#packaged-decks">Deck Packages</a> section.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="exporting"><a class="header" href="#exporting">Exporting</a></h1>

</ul>
<p>Exporting allows you to save part of your collection as a text file or
packaged Anki deck. To export, click the File menu and choose 'Export'.</p>
<h2 id="text-files-1"><a class="header" href="#text-files-1">Text Files</a></h2>
<p>If you choose &quot;Notes in Plain Text&quot;, Anki will write the contents of the
notes into a text file. Each field is separated by a tab. If you edit
the resulting file and don't modify the first field, you can later
import that file back into Anki and Anki will update your notes based on
your edits, provided you import back into the same note type.</p>
<p>If you find yourself needing to edit the first field as well, you'll
need to change the format of your note type so that the first field is
an ID number rather than actual text. (You can install
the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1672832404">Add note id</a>
add-on to make this easier.)</p>
<p>In order for formatting to be preserved when you import text back in,
the text is exported with all the HTML formatting embedded in it.</p>
<h2 id="packaged-decks"><a class="header" href="#packaged-decks">Packaged Decks</a></h2>
<p>A 'packaged deck' consists of cards, notes, note types, and any sounds or
images bundled up into a file ending with .apkg or .colpkg. You can use
packaged decks to transfer cards between people, or for backing up parts
of your collection.</p>
<p>There are two different kinds of packaged decks.</p>
<h3 id="collection-colpkg"><a class="header" href="#collection-colpkg">Collection (.colpkg)</a></h3>
<p>When you export all decks with scheduling included, this is called a
'collection package'. Anki will copy your entire collection into a file
ending in .colpkg, and place it on your desktop. A collection package is
used to back up your collection, or copy it to another device.</p>
<p>Collection packages created with previous versions of Anki were called
collection.apkg.</p>
<p>When this file is later imported, Anki will delete all the current cards
in the collection, and replace the collection with the items in the
file. This is useful for copying your collection back and forth between
devices.</p>
<p>Existing media in your collection is not deleted when you import a
collection package. To delete unused media, use Tools&gt;Check Media.</p>
<h3 id="deck-apkg"><a class="header" href="#deck-apkg">Deck (.apkg)</a></h3>
<p>Deck packages contain a single deck (and any child decks it may have).
They have a filename ending with .apkg, but a filename other than
collection.apkg. When you import a deck package, Anki will add the
contents into your collection, rather than overwriting your collection.</p>
<p>If some notes in the deck package have previously been imported, Anki
will keep the version with the most recent modification time. So if you
download an updated deck, the edits that have been made in the updated
version will be made in your collection as well, but if you re-import an
unchanged deck after making edits in your collection, the changes in
your collection will be kept.</p>
<p>If you choose not to include scheduling information, Anki will assume
that you are sharing the deck with other people, and will remove marked
and leech tags so that they will have a clean copy of it.</p>

<h2 id="checking-your-collection"><a class="header" href="#checking-your-collection">Checking Your Collection</a></h2>
<p>It is a good idea to occasionally check your collection file for
problems. You can do this via the Tools&gt;Check Database menu item.
Checking the database ensures the file has not been corrupted, rebuilds some
internal structures, and optimizes the file.</p>
<p>When you check the database, your tag list is also rebuilt. When you
delete individual decks or cards, Anki does not update the list of used
tags, as it's inefficient to do so. If you want to clear old tags out
from the list that are no longer in use, checking your database is the
way to do it.</p>
<p>Please note that Anki will automatically optimize your collection once
every 2 weeks. This optimization ensures the collection performs well,
but it does not check for errors or rebuild the tag list when
automatically optimizing.</p>
<h2 id="file-locations"><a class="header" href="#file-locations">File Locations</a></h2>
<p>On <strong>Windows</strong>, the latest Anki versions store your Anki files in your
appdata folder. You can access it by opening the file manager, and
typing <code>%APPDATA%\Anki2</code> in the location field. Older versions of Anki
stored your Anki files in a folder called <code>Anki</code> in your <code>Documents</code>
folder.</p>
<p>On <strong>Mac</strong> computers, recent Anki versions store all their files in the
<code>~/Library/Application Support/Anki2</code> folder. The Library folder is
hidden by default, but can be revealed in Finder by holding down the
option key while clicking on the Go menu. If you're on an older Anki
version, your Anki files will be in your <code>Documents/Anki</code> folder.</p>
<p>On <strong>Linux</strong>, recent Anki versions store your data in
<code>~/.local/share/Anki2</code>, or <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/Anki2</code> if you have set a
custom data path. Older versions of Anki stored your files in
<code>~/Documents/Anki</code> or <code>~/Anki</code>.</p>
<p>Within the Anki folder, the program-level and profile-level preferences
are stored in a file called prefs.db.</p>
<p>There is also a separate folder for each profile. The folder contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your notes, decks, cards and so on in a file called collection.anki2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your audio and images in a collection.media folder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A backups folder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some system files</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should never copy or move your collection while Anki is open. Doing
so could cause your collection to become corrupt. Please do not move or
modify the other files in the folder either.</p>
<h2 id="startup-options"><a class="header" href="#startup-options">Startup Options</a></h2>
<p>If you have made a destructive change on one computer and have an
undamaged copy on another computer, you may wish to start Anki without
syncing in order to use the full sync option without first downloading
the changes. Similarly, if you are experiencing problems with Anki, you
might want to (or might be instructed to) disable add-ons temporarily to
see if one might be causing the problem. You can do both of these things
by holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while starting Anki.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify a custom folder location during startup. This
is an advanced feature that is primarily intended to be used with
portable installations, and we recommend you use the default location in
most circumstances.</p>
<p>The syntax to specify an alternate folder is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>anki -b /path/to/anki/folder
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have multiple profiles, you can pass -p &lt;name&gt; to load
a specific profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To change the interface language, use -l &lt;iso 639-1 language
code&gt;, such as &quot;-l ja&quot; for Japanese.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you always want to use a custom folder location, you can modify your
shortcut to Anki. On Windows, right-click on the shortcut, choose
Properties, select the Shortcut tab, and add &quot;-b
\path\to\data\folder&quot; after the path to the program, which should
leave you with something like</p>
<pre><code>&quot;C:\Program Files\Anki\anki.exe&quot; -b &quot;C:\AnkiDataFolder&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use this technique with the -l option to easily use Anki in
different languages.</p>
<p>On Windows, you should use a backslash (\) not a forward slash (/).</p>
<p>On a Mac there is no easy way to alter the behaviour when clicking on
the Anki icon, but it is possible to start Anki with a custom base
folder from a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>open /Applications/Anki.app --args -b ~/myankifolder
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can define the environment variable &quot;ANKI_BASE&quot;.
On Windows, you can define the environment variable with:</p>
<pre><code>set &quot;ANKI_BASE=C:/path/to/AnkiDataFolder&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>On Linux and macOS, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>export ANKI_BASE=&quot;/path/to/AnkiDataFolder&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dropbox-and-file-syncing"><a class="header" href="#dropbox-and-file-syncing">DropBox and File Syncing</a></h2>
<p>We do not recommend you sync your Anki folder directly with a
third-party synchronization service, as it can lead to database
corruption when files are synced while in use.</p>
<p>If you just want to synchronize your media, you can link external
folders into services like DropBox. Please see <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180919153730/http://www.dropboxwiki.com/tips-and-tricks/sync-other-folders">DropboxWiki: Sync
Folders Outside Dropbox (archive.org)</a>
for more info.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep your collection in sync as well, it is strongly
recommended that you create a script that copies your files from your
synced folder to a local folder, launches Anki, and then copies the
files back when Anki is closed. This will ensure that the files are
never synchronized while they are open.</p>
<h2 id="network-filesystems"><a class="header" href="#network-filesystems">Network Filesystems</a></h2>
<p>We strongly recommend you have Anki store your files on a local hard
disk, as network filesystems can lead to database corruption. If a
network filesystem is your only option, regular use of Tools&gt;Check
Database to detect corruption is recommended.</p>
<h2 id="running-from-a-flash-drive"><a class="header" href="#running-from-a-flash-drive">Running from a Flash Drive</a></h2>
<p>On Windows, Anki can be installed on a USB / flash drive and run as a
portable application. The following example assumes your USB drive is
drive G.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy the \Program Files\Anki folder to the flash drive, so you
have a folder like G:\Anki.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a text file called G:\anki.bat with the following text:</p>
<p>g:\anki\anki.exe -b g:\ankidata</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to prevent the black command prompt window from
remaining open, you can instead use:</p>
<pre><code>start /b g:\anki\anki.exe -b g:\ankidata
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Double-clicking on anki.bat should start Anki with the user data
stored in G:\ankidata.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full path including drive letter is required - if you try using
<code>\anki\anki.exe</code> instead you will find syncing stops working.</p>
<p>Media syncing with AnkiWeb may not work if your flash drive is formatted
as FAT32. Please format the drive as NTFS to ensure media syncs
correctly.</p>
<h2 id="backups"><a class="header" href="#backups">Backups</a></h2>
<p>Each time your collection is closed (when closing Anki, switching
profiles, or synchronizing your deck), Anki exports your collection into
the backups folder. By default Anki will store up to 30 backups; you can
adjust this in the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>
<p>Automatic backups do not protect against disk or computer failure, and
do not extend to your media. To keep your collections safe, please
consider making manual backups too.</p>
<p>The easiest way to make a manual backup is to use the File&gt;Export
menu item to export all decks with scheduling and media information
included, which will save your data to a .colpkg file.</p>
<p>If you want to back up multiple profiles and your add-ons as well, you
can make a complete copy of your <a href="files.html#file-locations">Anki folder</a>. Please make sure
you close Anki first, as backups may be corrupt, if they are run while Anki is
open.</p>
<p>To restore from an automatic backup:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the File menu, select Switch Profile to show the Profiles
window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the profile you wish to restore on the left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Open Backup…​ button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose Yes and the available backups will appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a backup based on the date you wish to restore to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that that the backup that was restored was the one you
intended. If you wish to try a different backup, return to step 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anki has disabled automatic syncing and backups while you check the
backup. When you're happy with the backup you've selected, quit Anki
and start it again to return to the normal behaviour.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anki also logs deleted notes to a text file called deleted.txt in your
profile folder. These notes are in a text format that can be read by
File&gt;Import, though please note the import feature only supports a
single note type at one time, so if you have deleted notes from
different note types, you'll need to split the file into separate files
for each note type first.</p>
<h2 id="inaccessible-harddisk"><a class="header" href="#inaccessible-harddisk">Inaccessible Harddisk</a></h2>
<p>If Anki can't write to files in the <a href="files.html#file-locations">Anki folder</a>, a message
will be displayed on startup saying that Anki can't write to the
harddisk, and Anki will close. If you're unsure how to fix the
permissions, please contact someone near you who is knowledgeable about
computers and can help you out.</p>
<h2 id="permissions-of-temp-folder"><a class="header" href="#permissions-of-temp-folder">Permissions of Temp Folder</a></h2>
<p>Anki uses the system's temporary folder to store temporary data. If the
permissions of this folder have been changed from the default settings
by a rogue app or buggy antivirus app, Anki will not function properly.</p>
<p>If you're on a Windows 7 machine, the general steps to fix the problem
are listed below. As this is somewhat complicated, please ask someone
knowledgeable about Windows if you are not sure.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the start bar, and type in %temp% (including the percents),
then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go up one folder, and locate the temp folder. Right click on it, and
choose Properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the security tab, click on Advanced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the Owner tab. If you're not listed as the owner, click the
button to take ownership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the permissions tab, ensure that you have full control. On a
default W7 install the control will actually be inherited from
c:\users\your-username.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="corrupt-collections"><a class="header" href="#corrupt-collections">Corrupt Collections</a></h2>
<p>Anki uses a file format that is robust against program and computer
crashes, but it's still possible for your collection to become corrupt
if the files are modified while Anki is open, stored on a network drive,
or corrupted by a bug.</p>
<p>When you run Tools&gt;Check Database, you will receive a message if Anki
detects the file has been corrupted. <strong>The best way to recover from this
is to restore from the most recent <a href="files.html#backups">automatic backup</a></strong>, but
if your backup is too old, then you can attempt to repair the corruption
instead.</p>
<p>On Linux, make sure sqlite3 is installed. On a Mac, it should be
installed already. On Windows, download
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3_6_23.zip">http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-3_6_23.zip</a>.</p>
<p>Next, create a backup of your collection.anki2 file, in case something

<h3 id="linuxmacos"><a class="header" href="#linuxmacos">Linux/macOS</a></h3>
<p>Open a terminal, change to the folder your collection is located in, and

<pre><code>sqlite3 collection.anki2 .dump &gt; dump.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Open the resulting dump.txt file in a text editor, and look at the final
line. If it reads &quot;rollback;&quot;, change it to &quot;commit;&quot;</p>
<p>Then run the following in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>cat dump.txt | sqlite3 temp.file
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you use temp.file - do not put collection.anki2 on the right,
or you will blank out the file. When you're done, proceed to the final
step.</p>
<h3 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h3>
<p>Copy the <code>sqlite3.exe</code> program and your deck to your desktop. Then go to
<strong>Start&gt;Run</strong> and type in <code>cmd.exe</code>.</p>
<p>If you're on a recent Windows, the command prompt may not start on your
desktop. If you don't see desktop displayed in the command prompt, type
something like the following, replacing 'administrator' with your login
name.</p>
<pre><code>cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
</code></pre>
<p>Then type:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 collection.anki2 .dump &gt; dump.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Open the resulting dump.txt file in a text editor, and look at the final
line. If it reads &quot;rollback;&quot;, change it to &quot;commit;&quot;</p>
<p>Then run the following in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>type dump.txt | sqlite3 temp.file
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you use temp.file - do not put collection.anki2 on the right,
or you will blank out the file. When you're done, proceed to the final
step.</p>
<h3 id="final-step"><a class="header" href="#final-step">Final Step</a></h3>
<p>Check that you didn't get an error message, and that temp.file is not
empty. The procedure optimizes the collection in the process, so it's
normal for the new file to be somewhat smaller than the old one.</p>
<p>When you've confirmed the file is not empty:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>rename the original collection.anki2 file to something else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rename temp.file to collection.anki2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>move collection.anki2 back into your collection folder, overwriting
the old version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>start Anki and go to Tools&gt;Check Database to make sure the
collection has been successfully restored.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="card-info"><a class="header" href="#card-info">Card Info</a></h2>
<p>You can display information about a card by using the Cards&gt;Info menu item,
by right-clicking on the card and then selecting <strong>Info</strong>, or by pressing
<kbd>I</kbd> on the review screen.
Most of the displayed information should be self-explanatory. A few notes:</p>
<p><strong>Position</strong><br />
Only shown when the card is new, it shows the order the card will appear
in relative to other new cards. The position can be changed in the
browser.</p>
<p><strong>Interval</strong><br />
The delay from one review to the next. Times are abbreviated; &quot;0s, 1m,
3h, 4d, 5mo, 6y&quot; refers to seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and
years respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Ease</strong><br />
The approximate amount the interval will grow when you answer a review
card with the &quot;Good&quot; button.</p>
<h2 id="statistics"><a class="header" href="#statistics">Statistics</a></h2>
<p>The statistics window is accessed by clicking on <strong>Stats</strong> button at the
top of the main window, or by pressing <kbd>T</kbd>. The statistics
window will show statistics from the currently selected deck and any
subdecks. If you select the checkbox &quot;collection&quot; at the top, statistics
will be shown for your entire collection instead. You can also display graphs
for arbitrary searches by adding filters in the search box at the top (2.1.28+).</p>
<p>(Anki 2.1.28+ introduced redesigned graphs. The old graphs are currently still
accessible with a <kbd>Shift</kbd>-click on the Stats button.)</p>
<p>By default, Anki 2.1.28+ will show you statistics for the last 12 months.
You can change this to all history scope or deck life scope at the top. (The
&quot;today&quot; section at the top remains of course unaffected by this selection.)</p>
<p>Older versions of Anki will by default show you statistics for
the previous month. You can change this to a year scope or deck life scope
at the bottom. (Again, the “today” section at the top is unaffected
by this selection.)</p>
<p>Clicking on &quot;Save PDF&quot; at the bottom will save a PDF document of the statistics to a file
on your desktop to make it easy to share your statistics with others.</p>
<p>When you delete notes, their review history is maintained in Anki. It
will not be included when looking at statistics for a specific deck (as
Anki has no way of knowing which deck the deleted cards belonged to),
but will be included when you look at statistics for the whole
collection.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-cards"><a class="header" href="#types-of-cards">Types of Cards</a></h2>
<p>The stats window uses some terms that you may not be familiar with:</p>
<p><strong>Mature</strong><br />
A mature card is one that has an interval of 21 days or greater.</p>
<p><strong>Young</strong><br />
A young card is one that has an interval of less than 21 days, but is
not in learning.</p>
<p><strong>Learn</strong><br />
A learning card is one that is still in learning mode (using whatever
steps may be defined in the deck’s options).</p>
<p><strong>Relearn</strong><br />
A relearning card is a card that you have failed in review mode, thus
returning it to learning mode to be relearned.</p>
<p><strong>Unseen</strong><br />
An unseen card is one that has been added to your collection but has not
yet entered learning mode. Unseen cards are sometimes referred to as
&quot;new&quot; cards, especially when they are in the &quot;new&quot; queue to be shown for
the first time.</p>
<h2 id="today"><a class="header" href="#today">Today</a></h2>
<p>At the top of the statistics window is a brief list of textual
statistics about the reviews that you have completed today. A “review”
in this context is 'one answering of a card', so a card might count as
multiple reviews if it needed to be seen multiple times, and a learning
card answered also counts as a “review.” A couple of the stats whose
meaning may not be immediately obvious:</p>
<p><strong>Again Count</strong><br />
This is the number of reviews that you have failed (i.e., pressed Again
on). The correct percentage listed afterwards is the number of cards you
did 'not' fail divided by the total number of cards you studied.</p>
<p><strong>Learn, Review, Relearn, Filtered</strong><br />
The number of reviews that were learning cards, review cards, relearning
cards, or studied in a filtered deck when not due.</p>
<p>The stats for the current day are not a good overall indicator of your
learning progress; everyone has bad days and good days, and seeing that
you got a lower percentage correct on a particular day should not be
cause for concern. The remainder of the stats, which take longer periods
of time into account, will give more useful information if you wish to
try to change your study habits or scheduling settings based on your
performance.</p>
<p>The “today” statistics are unaffected by the time period selected at the
bottom of the window.</p>
<h2 id="the-graphs"><a class="header" href="#the-graphs">The Graphs</a></h2>
<p><strong>Future Due</strong><br />
This graph shows an estimated number of reviews that will be due on a
given day in the future if you learn no new cards and fail no cards. The
bars and the left axis show the number of cards due on each day if you
study all cards each day, while the line and the right axis show the
number of cards due on that day if you don’t study at all until then.
Note that the forecast graph does not count reviews that are currently
overdue, so if you have a large backlog, the overdue cards will not be
displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong><br />
This graph counts the number of card reviews you have done. The bars may
correspond to days, weeks, or months, depending on the time period
you’ve selected at the bottom of the screen. The differently colored
blocks show how many of the cards you answered on each day were
<a href="stats.html#types-of-cards">mature</a>, young, relearning, or learning cards.
There is also a separate group for cards answered in a filtered/cram
deck while they were not due. The line and the right axis shows the
cumulative total for each type of review as time progresses across the
graph (so at 0 days, it would display the number for the entire time
period displayed on the graph).</p>
<p><strong>Card Counts</strong><br />
This pie chart shows what percentage of your deck or collection consists
of mature, unseen, young/learn, and suspended cards. If you wish to
calculate a more precise percentage, the key shows the exact number of
cards in each section, and the total number of cards is displayed to the
side.</p>
<p><strong>Review Time</strong><br />
This graph works exactly like Review Count, except that it deals with
the amount of time you spent on each card rather than the number of
cards answered.</p>
<p><strong>Review Intervals</strong><br />
This graph displays the number of cards that have a given interval (the
delay between two reviews). The line and the right axis tell you what
percentage of your cards have an interval of less than or equal to the
time below that point. The time scope has a different effect on this
graph than other graphs: rather than changing which cards or period of
studying is included, it limits how far out the intervals are displayed
to (so 14-month intervals are not displayed at all on a 1-year graph).</p>
<p><strong>Hourly Breakdown</strong><br />
This graph shows what percentage of total reviews you have passed (i.e.,
not pressed Again on) during given hours. The larger, darker bars and
left axis show the success rate; the thinner, lighter bars and right
axis show the number of reviews you’ve made at that hour (so you know
how significant the results are).</p>
<p><strong>Answer Buttons</strong><br />
This graph shows how many times you’ve chosen the Again, Hard, Good, or
Easy button while studying learning/new, young, and
<a href="stats.html#types-of-cards">mature</a> cards. Anki also displays the percentage
of correct reviews for each type of card.</p>
<h2 id="manual-analysis"><a class="header" href="#manual-analysis">Manual Analysis</a></h2>
<p>If you’re interested in getting information from your statistics other
than what Anki provides, it is possible to access the data directly.
Because of the complexity involved, this is not something we can provide
any support for.</p>
<p>One option is to <a href="addons.html">write an add-on</a> that adds another graph or
more details to the statistics window. There are several add-ons of this
sort on AnkiWeb already, which you can look at to get an idea of how it
works.</p>
<p>A more powerful and more complex option is to extract the review log
information directly from Anki’s database and analyze it in an external
program. Anki uses a database format called SQLite. There are many tools
available for working with SQLite databases; one of the easiest to start
with is called <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/">SQLite Browser</a>, which will
allow you to look around the database as well as export a CSV version of
tables for import into another program.</p>
<p>The most important table for statistics is the 'revlog' table, which
stores an entry for each review that you conduct. The columns are as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>id</strong><br />
The time at which the review was conducted, as the number of
milliseconds that had passed since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970.
(This is sometimes known as 'Unix epoch time', especially when in
straight seconds instead of milliseconds.)</p>
<p><strong>cid</strong><br />
The ID of the card that was reviewed. You can look up this value in the
id field of the 'cards' table to get more information about the card,
although note that the card could have changed between when the revlog
entry was recorded and when you are looking it up. It is also the
millisecond timestamp of the card’s creation time.</p>
<p><strong>usn</strong><br />
This column is used to keep track of the sync state of reviews and
provides no useful information for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>ease</strong><br />
Which button you pressed at the end of the review (1 for Again, 4 for
Easy).</p>
<p><strong>ivl</strong><br />
The new interval that the card was pushed to after the review. Positive
values are in days; negative values are in seconds (for learning cards).</p>
<p><strong>lastIvl</strong><br />
The interval the card had before the review. Cards introduced for the
first time have a last interval equal to the Again delay.</p>
<p><strong>factor</strong><br />
The new ease factor of the card in permille (parts per thousand). If the
ease factor is 2500, the card’s interval will be multiplied by 2.5 the
next time you press Good.</p>
<p><strong>time</strong><br />
The amount of time (in milliseconds) you spent on the question and
answer sides of the card before selecting an ease button.</p>
<p><strong>type</strong><br />
This is 0 for learning cards, 1 for review cards, 2 for relearning cards,
and 3 for early &quot;cram&quot; cards (cards being studied in a filtered deck when they
are not due).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="media-1"><a class="header" href="#media-1">Media</a></h1>
<p>Anki stores the sounds and images used in your notes in a folder next to
the collection. For more on the folder location, please see the <a href="files.html">file
locations</a> section. When you add media within Anki, either by
using the paperclip icon in the <a href="editing.html">editor</a> or by pasting it into
a field, Anki will copy it from its original location into the media
folder. This makes it easy to back up your collection’s media or move it
to another computer. </p>
<p>If your media filenames contain spaces or other special characters such 
as percentage signs, the way the filenames appear in the HTML editor will 
differ from the way the filenames appear on disk. For example, a file called 
<code>hello 100%.jpg</code> will appear as <code>hello%20100%25.jpg</code> in the HTML editor. 
Internally, Anki still uses the original filenames, so if you would like to
<a href="searching.html">search</a> for the file or modify the filename with <a href="browsing.html#find-and-replace">Find&amp;Replace</a>, you will 
need to use the name as it appears on disk, not as it appears in the 
HTML editor. Exporting to a text file is another way to see the underlying 
representation.</p>
<p>You can use the Tools&gt;Check Media menu option to scan your notes and
media folder. It will generate a report of files in the media folder
that are not used by any notes, and media referenced in notes but
missing from your media folder. It does not scan question or answer
templates, which is why you can’t place media references to fields in
the template. If you need a static image or sound on every card, name it
with a leading _ (e.g., <code>\_dog.jpg</code>) to tell Anki to ignore it when
checking for media. If you delete media using the unused media check,
Anki will move it into your operating system’s trash folder, so you can
recover if you accidentally delete media that shouldn’t have been
deleted.</p>
<p>Anki uses a program called mpv (and mplayer as a fallback) in order to support
sounds and videos. A wide variety of file formats are supported, but not all of
these formats will work on AnkiWeb and the mobile clients. MP3 audio and
MP4 video seems to be the most universally supported.</p>

<h2 id="mathjax"><a class="header" href="#mathjax">MathJax</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a> is a modern, browser-based
typesetting system, useful for mathematical and chemical equations. It
does not require the installation of any extra software, so it is easy
to use, and it is recommended for most users.</p>
<p>MathJax is supported out of the box on Anki 2.1+, AnkiMobile, and
AnkiDroid 2.9+.</p>
<p>To try it out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type the following in a field:</p>
<pre><code>\sqrt{x}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the text you just typed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the rightmost button in the editor, and choose &quot;MathJax
inline&quot; from the menu. Anki will change the text so it reads:</p>
<pre><code>\(\sqrt{x}\)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you click the Cards…​ button, you’ll see a preview of how the
equation will appear when the card is reviewed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anki’s MathJax support expects content in TeX format. If you’re not
familiar with TeX formatting, please see <a href="https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference">this
cheatsheet</a>.
Please note that point 2 does not apply in Anki - Anki uses <code>\(</code> and
<code>\)</code> for inline equations, and <code>\[</code> and <code>\]</code> for display equations.</p>
<p>If you want to use newlines in a MathJax expression, please use
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> instead of just <kbd>Enter</kbd>, as a normal newline will prevent
MathJax from working correctly.</p>
<p>Anki includes built in support for mhchem for rendering chemical
equations. Please see the 'chemical equations' section and the following
sections for more information:
<a href="https://mhchem.github.io/MathJax-mhchem/">https://mhchem.github.io/MathJax-mhchem/</a></p>
<p>It is possible to <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/customizing-mathjax.html">customize some settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="latex"><a class="header" href="#latex">LaTeX</a></h2>
<p>LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system, useful for entering mathematical
formulas, chemical formulas, musical notation and so on. Anki provides
some support for LaTeX, allowing you to enter LaTeX code in your notes.
When you review a card, Anki will call LaTeX and display the generated
image instead.</p>
<p>LaTeX is more work to set up, and images can only be generated with the
computer version of Anki - though once generated, the images can be
displayed by mobile clients. Because of the extra complexity LaTeX
brings, it is only recommended for users that need more features than
MathJax provides.</p>
<h3 id="assumed-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#assumed-knowledge">Assumed Knowledge</a></h3>
<p>Anki’s LaTeX support is not turn-key: it is assumed that you know how to
use LaTeX already, and that you have it installed. If you have no
experience with LaTeX, please consult one of the many guides available
on the internet. If you are having trouble with markup, please ask on a
LaTeX forum.</p>
<p>To install LaTeX, on Windows use MiKTeX; on macOS use MacTex, and on Linux
use your distro’s package manager. Dvipng must also be installed.</p>
<p>On Windows, go to Settings in MikTek’s maintenance window, and make sure
&quot;Install missing packages on the fly&quot; is set to &quot;No&quot;, not to &quot;Ask me
first&quot;. If you continue to have difficulties, one user reported that
running Anki as an administrator until all the packages were fetched
helped.</p>
<p>On macOS, LaTeX has only been tested with MacTex and BasicTex. If you use
BasicTex, you need to install dvipng separately, with the following
command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo tlmgr update --self; sudo tlmgr install dvipng
</code></pre>
<p>The command may not be on the path, so you may need to provide the full
path, eg /usr/local/texlive/2014basic/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr.</p>
<p>If you are not using the above LaTeX packages, you will need to use the
<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/937148547">edit LaTeX</a> add-on to specify
the full path to latex and dvipng.</p>
<h3 id="webmobile"><a class="header" href="#webmobile">Web/Mobile</a></h3>
<p>When you review a card with LaTeX on it, Anki will generate an image for
that LaTeX and place the image in your collection’s media folder for
future use. The web &amp; mobile clients will display these images if they
already exist, but can not generate the images on their own.</p>
<p>To avoid having to review all your cards at least once before you can
study on the other clients, Anki can generate the images in bulk for
you. To generate all the images, please go to Tools&gt;Check Media.
After that, syncing should upload the generated media to AnkiWeb and the
other clients.</p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>The most general way to input LaTeX content is to surround it with
[latex][/latex] tags. There’s a shortcut button for this documented
in the <a href="editing.html">editor</a> section.</p>
<p>[latex] tags must be used inside a field - placing them in the card
template will <a href="templates/fields.html">cause problems</a>.</p>
<p>For example, entering the following on the front of an Anki flashcard:</p>
<pre><code>Does [latex]\begin{math}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\end{math}[/latex] converge?
</code></pre>
<p>will produce this when the flashcard is viewed:</p>
<p><img src="math/convergence_question.png" alt="convergence question" /></p>
<p>The formula in the example above is called a 'text formula', because it
is displayed right within the non-mathematical text. In contrast, the
following example shows a 'displayed formula':</p>
<pre><code>Does the sum below converge?

[latex]\begin{displaymath}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\end{displaymath}[/latex]
</code></pre>
<p><img src="math/convergence_question_2.png" alt="convergence question 2" /></p>
<p>'Text formulas' and 'display formulas' are the most common type of LaTeX
expressions, so Anki provides abbreviated versions of them. Expressions
of the form:</p>
<pre><code>[latex]\begin{math}...\end{math}[/latex]
</code></pre>
<p>can be shortened to</p>
<pre><code>[$]...[/$]
</code></pre>
<p>and expressions of the form</p>
<pre><code>[latex]\begin{displaymath}...\end{displaymath}[/latex]
</code></pre>
<p>can be shortened to</p>
<pre><code>[$$]...[/$$]
</code></pre>
<p>For example, the two LaTeX snippets shown before are equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>Does [$]\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}[/$] converge?
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>Does the sum below converge?

[$$]\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}[/$$]
</code></pre>
<p>respectively.</p>
<h3 id="packages"><a class="header" href="#packages">Packages</a></h3>
<p>Anki allows you to customize the LaTeX preamble so you can import custom
packages for chemistry, music and so on. For example, imagine you find
an example file for chemtex on the internet:</p>
<pre><code>\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{report}
\usepackage{chemtex}
\begin{document}

\initial
\begin{figure}[h]\centering
\parbox{.3\textwidth}{\ethene{H}{H$_3$C}{CH$_3$}{Br}}
\hfil
\parbox{.3\textwidth}{\cbranch{H}{S}{H}{S}{C}{S}{}{S}{H}
  \xi=-200 \cright{}{Q}{C}{D}{O}{S}{OH}}
\hfil
\parbox{.3\textwidth}{\hetisix{Q}{Q}{Q}{Q}{Q}{Q}{O}{Q}{O}
  \xi=-171 \fuseup{Q}{Q}{Q}{Q}{D}{Q}{D}{Q}{D}}
\caption{Chemie mit {\tt CHEMTEX}\label{a1}}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
</code></pre>
<p>Firstly, follow the documentation of the package and MiKTeX/MacTex in
order to install the package. To check the package is working, you’ll
want to put code like the above into a .latex file and test if you can
compile it from the command line. Once you’ve confirmed that the package
is available and working, we can integrate it with Anki.</p>
<p>To use the package with Anki, click &quot;Add&quot; in the main window, then click
the note type selection button. Click the &quot;Manage&quot; button, then select
the note type you plan to use and click &quot;Options&quot;. The LaTeX header and
footer are shown. The header will look something like:</p>
<pre><code>\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\special{papersize=3in,5in}
\usepackage{amssymb,amsmath}
\pagestyle{empty}
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}
\begin{document}
</code></pre>
<p>To use chemtex, you’d add the usepackage line in the earlier example, so
it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\special{papersize=3in,5in}
\usepackage{amssymb,amsmath}
\usepackage{chemtex}
\pagestyle{empty}
\setlength{\parindent}{0in}
\begin{document}
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you should be able to include lines like the following in
your Anki cards:</p>
<pre><code>[latex]\ethene{H}{H$_3$C}{CH$_3$}{Br}[/latex]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="template-conflicts"><a class="header" href="#template-conflicts">Template Conflicts</a></h3>
<p>As of Anki 2.1.20 / AnkiMobile 2.0.56 / AnkiDroid 2.13, this workaround is no
longer required, as <code>{{field}}</code> text inside fields no longer causes problems. If
you need to support older versions and want to keep using this syntax, please
make sure you place the <code>{{=&lt;% %&gt;=}}</code> string at the very top of your front and
back template, as recent Anki versions will not recognize it anywhere but the
start.</p>
<p>For older versions:</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for {{ and }} to pop up in LaTeX code when writing
mathematical equations. To ensure that your LaTeX equations don’t
conflict with Anki’s field replacements, it’s possible to change the
separator to something else.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a template:</p>
<pre><code>{{latex field}}
</code></pre>
<p>Changing it to the following will make it unlikely that the LaTeX will
conflict:</p>
<pre><code>{{=&lt;% %&gt;=}}
&lt;%latex field%&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="cloze-conflicts"><a class="header" href="#cloze-conflicts">Cloze Conflicts</a></h3>
<p>Cloze deletions are terminated with <code>}}</code>, which can conflict with a <code>}}</code>
appearing in your LaTeX. To prevent LaTeX from being interpreted as a closing
cloze marker, you can put a space between any double closing braces that do not
indicate the end of the cloze, so</p>
<pre><code>{{c1::[$]\frac{foo}{\frac{bar}{baz}}[/$] blah blah blah.}}
</code></pre>
<p>will not work, but</p>
<pre><code>{{c1::[$]\frac{foo}{\frac{bar}{baz} }[/$] blah blah blah.}}
</code></pre>
<p>will (and LaTeX ignores spaces in math mode, so your equation will
render the same). If you want to avoid adding the extra space into the
rendered text (for example, when you are making Cloze cards for learning
programming languages), another option is to use a HTML comment when
editing the card in HTML mode:</p>
<pre><code>{{c1::[$]\frac{foo}{\frac{bar}{baz}&lt;!-- --&gt;}[/$] blah blah blah.}}
</code></pre>
<p>You may use either workaround if you need to use the <code>::</code> character
sequence within the Cloze-deleted text. The first card generated for the
following note text will read <code>[type] in C++ is a type-safe union</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{{c1::std:&lt;!-- --&gt;:variant::~type~}} in C++ is a {{c2::type-safe union}}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="unsafe-commands"><a class="header" href="#unsafe-commands">Unsafe Commands</a></h3>
<p>Anki prohibits certain commands like \input or \def from being used on
cards or in templates, because allowing them could allow malicious
shared decks to damage your system. (To be on the safe side, these
commands are prohibited even in comments, so if you’re getting this
error but don’t think you’ve used one, please double-check any comments
you have in your headers, templates, and cards.) If you need to use
these commands, please add them to a system package and import that
package as described in the previous section.</p>

</ul>
<p>Leeches are cards that you keep on forgetting. Because they require so
many reviews, they take up a lot more of your time than other cards.</p>
<p>Anki can help you identify leeches. Each time a review card 'lapses' (is
failed while it is review mode), a counter is increased. When that
counter reaches 8, the note is tagged as a leech, and the card is
suspended. The threshold, and whether to suspend or not, can be adjusted
in the <a href="deck-options.html">deck options</a>.</p>
<p>Anki will continue to issue leech warnings periodically for a difficult
card. The warning interval is half the initial leech threshold. That is,
if you have Anki configured to warn at 8 lapses, future warnings will
happen every 4 lapses. (12, 16, etc)</p>
<p>Once a leech is found, there are a number of ways you can handle it.</p>
<h2 id="waiting"><a class="header" href="#waiting">Waiting</a></h2>
<p>Some leeches are caused by 'interference'. For example, an English
learner may have recently learnt the words &quot;disappoint&quot; and &quot;disappear&quot;.
As they look similar, the learner may find themselves confusing the two
when trying to answer. In these situations, it’s often productive to
concentrate on just one idea. When that idea is firmly ingrained in your
mind, you can then return to learning the other idea. So in these
situations, you may want to leave one of the words suspended until you
have learnt the other one well, and then unsuspend it in the browser.</p>
<h2 id="deleting"><a class="header" href="#deleting">Deleting</a></h2>
<p>Another way to manage leeches is to delete them. Consider if the
material you’re struggling with is important enough to make it worth
your while. By selectively deleting difficult and obscure items, you can
dedicate more time to learning other material, and studying becomes a
lot more fun.</p>
<h2 id="editing"><a class="header" href="#editing">Editing</a></h2>
<p>Another approach is to change the way the information is presented.
Perhaps the cards you have created have too much information on them, or
perhaps you’re trying to memorize something without fully understanding
it. Sometimes spending some time changing the way the card is phrased
can help. It’s also a good time to think about making a mnemonic to help
you remember.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="add-ons"><a class="header" href="#add-ons">Add-ons</a></h1>
<p>Anki's capabilities can be extended with add-ons. Add-ons can provide
features like extra support for specific languages, extra control over
scheduling, and so on.</p>
<p>To browse the list of available add-ons, select the Tools&gt;Add-ons
menu item, then click on Get Add-ons.</p>
<p>If you have downloaded an add-on that is not working properly, or if you
accidentally made a mistake when editing an add-on, you can use the
&quot;Delete&quot; option in the menu to remove it.</p>
<p>Add-ons use and modify arbitrary parts of Anki’s codebase, so in some
cases, updating Anki can break the compatibility with older add-ons. If 
one of your add-ons stops working after updating Anki, please consider
reporting the issue to the add-on author. If you rely on this add-on,
you will need to keep using an older Anki version until the add-on gets 
an update. </p>
<p>There is a &quot;Contact Author&quot; button on most add-ons pages on Ankiweb, 
and many authors include their email address in the add-on, so if you
need to get in touch with the author, editing the add-on and looking at
the top of the file may help.</p>
<p>To learn how to write your own add-ons, please see the <a href="https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net">add-on writing
guide</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="menu-shortcuts"><a class="header" href="#menu-shortcuts">Menu Shortcuts</a></h2>
<p>On Windows/Linux you can hold down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and press a highlighted
letter to activate a particular menu.</p>
<p>Although macOS doesn’t support this feature, it does allow you instead to assign
shortcuts to specific menu items. Please see
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/343328/create-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-any-menu-action-in-any-program">http://lifehacker.com/343328/create-a-keyboard-shortcut-for-any-menu-action-in-any-program</a>
for more information.</p>
<h2 id="debug-console"><a class="header" href="#debug-console">Debug Console</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you may be asked to use the debug console to change a setting
or check something. Unless asked to enter text in the &quot;debug console&quot;,
you will probably not need this. Advanced users may like to read more
about it in the <a href="https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/debugging.html#debug-console">add-on writing guide</a>.</p>
<p>When asked to enter text into the &quot;debug console&quot;, please start Anki,
and in the main window, press</p>
<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd></p>
<p>(the control key, shift key, and semi-colon key at the same time)</p>
<p>On a Mac, press</p>
<p><kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd></p>
<p>(the command key, shift key, and semi-colon key at the same time)</p>
<p>On some non-English keyboards, you may need to press <kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>+</kbd> instead
of <kbd>;</kbd>.</p>
<p>In the window that has popped up, please paste the text you were asked
to paste in the top section. When you’ve done so, please press
Ctrl+Return (Command+Return on a Mac), and some text should appear in
the bottom section. If you’ve been asked to paste the resulting output,
please copy it from the bottom area, and paste it back to the support
person.</p>
<p>If you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> instead of just <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>, Anki will
try to print the result rather than doing what you asked it to. If you
are getting unexpected errors, please make sure you’re not holding down
the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-decks-publicly"><a class="header" href="#sharing-decks-publicly">Sharing Decks Publicly</a></h2>
<p>To share decks with the general public, <a href="syncing.html">synchronize</a> them
with AnkiWeb, then log into AnkiWeb and click on &quot;Share&quot; from the menu
next to the deck you wish to share.</p>
<p>If you shared a deck previously (including with previous versions of
Anki), you can update it by clicking &quot;Share&quot; as above. Updating a shared
deck will not reset the download counts or ratings. You can delete a
shared deck that you have uploaded using the Delete button on the shared
deck's page.</p>
<p>When updating a deck, AnkiWeb expects the deck to be at the same
location as before. If you shared a deck when it was called &quot;Korean
Verbs&quot; for example, and then renamed it to &quot;Korean::Korean Verbs&quot;,
resharing will not be able to update the existing copy. If you have
forgotten the original name, please contact support.</p>
<p>When you update a shared deck, users who downloaded the deck previously
will not automatically receive updates. If they download the deck again
and re-import it, newly added material will be imported without altering
their existing study progress, provided neither you nor the user has
altered the note type since the first import.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-decks-privately"><a class="header" href="#sharing-decks-privately">Sharing Decks Privately</a></h2>
<p>If you’d like to share decks with a limited group of people (such as a
study group or class) rather than the general public, you can do so by
sharing them outside of AnkiWeb.</p>
<p>To share a deck privately, go to the File menu and choose Export. Select
a single deck (not &quot;All Decks&quot;), and turn off &quot;include scheduling
information&quot;. This will produce an .apkg file which you can share with
others.</p>
<p>You can share the .apkg file by emailing it to people, placing it on a
website or shared folder, or using a free file sharing service like
Dropbox or Google Drive and sending people a link.</p>
<p>Both the computer version and mobile clients make it easy to import from
an apkg file simply by clicking or tapping on it. AnkiWeb does not have
the ability to import apkg files however, so the recipients of your deck
will need to have the computer version or Anki on their mobile device.</p>
<p>When a user imports an .apkg file, cards that already exist in their
collection will be ignored and any new cards will be added. As long as
they use the same note type, modified cards will also be updated. To
prevent data loss, cards that have been deleted in the new apkg file
will not be deleted in the user’s collection, so if you need to delete
cards from users' decks for whatever reason, you will need to contact
them about it.</p>
