<p>Deck options primarily control the way Anki schedules cards. It is recommended
that you spend a few weeks with the defaults to get a feel for how Anki works
before you start adjusting options. Please make sure you understand the options
before changing them, as mistakes could reduce Anki's effectiveness.</p>
<p>Deck options are accessed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking the gear icon on the <code>Decks</code> screen.</li>
<li>Selecting a deck on the <code>Decks</code> screen, and then clicking <code>Options</code>
at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Clicking on <code>More</code> &gt; <code>Options</code> while in review mode.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>o</code> while in review mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This page describes the options shown in Anki 2.1.45+, when you have the v2 or
v3 scheduler enabled. On older versions, some options will not be available, or
will appear in a different section.</p>
<h2 id="presets"><a class="header" href="#presets">Presets</a></h2>
<p>Anki allows you to share options between different decks, to make
updating options in many decks at once easy. To do this, options are
grouped into <em>presets</em>. By default, all newly created decks use
the same preset.</p>
<p>If you’d like to alter the settings on one deck but not other decks, click the
arrow icon in the top right of the Deck Options window. The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Save</strong>: Saves all modifications you've made since opening the deck options screen.</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong>: Add a new preset, with the default options.</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong>: Clone your current present, which is useful if you
just want to modify certain options, keeping the rest as they are.</li>
<li><strong>Rename</strong>  Changes the name of the current preset.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> Deletes the current preset. This will require that the next sync is
a one-way sync.</li>
<li><strong>Save to all subdecks</strong>. Like <em>Save</em>, but also assigns the selected preset to all
subdecks of the currently selected deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deck Options are not retroactive. For example, if you change an option that
controls the delay after failing a card, cards that you failed prior to
changing the option will have the old delay, not the new one.</p>
<h2 id="subdecks"><a class="header" href="#subdecks">Subdecks</a></h2>
<p>If your deck has subdecks, each deck can optionally be assigned a different preset.
When Anki shows a card, it will check which subdeck the card is in, and use the options
for that deck. There are some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new cards/day and reviews/day <a href="#daily-limits">limits</a> behave differently
depending on the scheduler version you have selected.</li>
<li>The <a href="#display-order">display order</a> options in the v3 scheduler are taken from the
deck you select to study, not the deck of the current card.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let's say you have this collection:</p>
<pre><code>- Deck A (Preset 1)
  - Deck A::Subdeck B (Preset 2)
    - Card B1
    - Card B2
</code></pre>
<p>Preset 1 and 2 are identical, with two exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preset 1:
<ul>
<li>New Cards - Learning steps: 1m 10m</li>
<li>Display Order - New/review priority: Mix with reviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preset 2:
<ul>
<li>New Cards - Learning steps: 20m 2h</li>
<li>Display Order - New/review priority: Show after reviews</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to study Deck A:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning steps for all new cards will be 20m 2h (preset 2 applies)</li>
<li>All new cards will be mixed with reviews (preset 1 applies)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to study Subdeck B:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning steps for all new cards will be 20m 2h (preset 2 applies)</li>
<li>All new cards will be shown after reviews (preset 2 applies)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="daily-limits"><a class="header" href="#daily-limits">Daily Limits</a></h2>
<h3 id="new-cardsday"><a class="header" href="#new-cardsday">New Cards/Day</a></h3>
<p>Controls how many new cards are introduced each day you open the program. If you
study fewer than the limit, or miss a day, the next day the counts will be back
to your limit - they do not accumulate.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">the v3 scheduler</a>, Anki
uses the limits of the deck you select as an upper limit on the number of cards.
This means if &quot;French&quot; has a limit of 20 cards and &quot;French::Lesson 1&quot; and
&quot;French::Lesson 2&quot; both have limits of 15 cards, when you click on &quot;French&quot;,
you’ll get at most 15 cards from either child deck, and only 20 cards in total.</p>
<p>In the v1 or v2 scheduler, each parent applies its limits to its children. If you
have decks in a grandparent-parent-child arrangement, both the grandparent and
parent limits will alter how many cards are shown from the child, even if you
click directly on the child. In the v3 scheduler, this has been simplified, and 
now each deck's limit controls how many cards from that specific deck can be used.
Imagine that you have this collection:</p>
<pre><code>- Parent deck (New Cards/Day: 20) 
  - Child deck (New Cards/Day: 7)
    - Grandchild deck A (New Cards/Day: 5)
      - Cards 1 to 50
    - Grandchild deck B (New Cards/Day: 5) 
      - Cards 51 to 100
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If you click on the Parent deck, you will get 10 new cards (from Grandchild decks A and B).</li>
<li>If you click on the Child deck, you will get 7 new cards (from Grandchild decks A and B).</li>
<li>If you click on any of the Grandchild decks, you will get 5 new cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Studying new cards will temporarily increase the number of reviews you need to
do a day, as freshly learnt material needs to be repeated a number of times
before the delay between repetitions can increase appreciably. If you are
consistently learning 20 new cards a day, you can expect your daily reviews to
be roughly about 200 cards/day. You can decrease the reviews required by
introducing fewer new cards each day, or by turning off new card display until
your review burden decreases. More than one Anki user has excitedly studied
hundreds of new cards over their first few days of using the program, and then
become overwhelmed by the reviews required.</p>
<p>If using <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">the v3 scheduler</a>,
please keep in mind that the new count is capped by the review count. If your
review limit is set to 200, and you have 190 reviews waiting, a maximum of 10
new cards will be introduced. If your review limit has been reached, no new
cards will be shown. If you have a backlog of reviews and still want to
introduce new cards, you can do so by suspending the reviews, or increasing your
review limit. That said, it is recommended you hold off on new cards until you
catch up instead, as introducing more new cards when you're behind will only
make the backlog worse.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-reviewsday"><a class="header" href="#maximum-reviewsday">Maximum Reviews/Day</a></h3>
<p>Allows you to set an upper limit on the number of reviews to show each day.
When this limit is reached, Anki will not show any more review cards for the
day, even if there are some waiting. If you study consistently, this setting can
help to smooth out occasional peaks in due card counts, and can save you from a
heart attack when returning to Anki after a week off. When reviews have been
hidden due to this option, a message will appear in the congratulations screen,
suggesting you consider increasing the limit if you have time.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html#daily-limits">the v3 scheduler</a> and
v1 schedulers, the counts are affected by parents/selected decks in the same way
as new cards.</p>
<p>In the v2 scheduler, the limit is taken solely from the deck you select - any
limits on its parents or child decks are ignored.</p>
<p>The v3 scheduler includes learning cards with a 1+ day delay in the review count,
so those learning cards will be subject to the daily limit.</p>
<h2 id="new-cards"><a class="header" href="#new-cards">New Cards</a></h2>
<p>The settings in this section only affect new cards and cards in initial
<a href="studying.html#learningrelearning-cards">learning</a> mode. Once a card
has graduated (i.e. there are no more learning steps for this card), it  becomes a
<a href="studying.html#review-cards">review card</a>, and the
settings in this section are no longer applicable.</p>
<h3 id="learning-steps"><a class="header" href="#learning-steps">Learning Steps</a></h3>
<p>Controls the number of learning repetitions, and the delay
between them. One or more delays, separated by spaces must be entered.
Each time you press <code>Good</code> during review, the card moves to the next step.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that your learning steps are <strong>1m 10m 1d</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you press <code>Again</code>, the card goes back to first step, and will be shown
again approximately 1 minute later.</li>
<li>When you press <code>Good</code> on a new card, or a card answered <code>Again</code>, it will move
to the next step, and be shown again in approximately 10 minutes.</li>
<li>When you press <code>Good</code> on a card after the 10 minute step, it will be delayed
until the next day.</li>
<li>When you press <code>Good</code> on the card the next day, it will leave learning (i.e. it will graduate), and
become a review card. It will be shown again after the delay configured by the
<em>graduating interval</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s nothing else to study, Anki will show cards up to 20 minutes
early by default. The amount of time to look ahead is configurable in
the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="studying.html#learningrelearning-cards">learning</a> section for more info on how
steps work. Also, check <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/deck-options-explained/213">this forum's
post</a> for more
examples.</p>
<h4 id="day-boundaries"><a class="header" href="#day-boundaries">Day Boundaries</a></h4>
<p>Anki treats small steps and steps that <a href="./preferences.html#scheduling">cross a day boundary</a> differently.
With small steps, the cards are shown as soon as the delay has passed,
in preference to other waiting cards like reviews. This is done so that
you can answer the card as closely to your requested delay as possible.
In contrast, if the interval crosses a day boundary, it is automatically 
converted to days.</p>
<h3 id="graduating-interval"><a class="header" href="#graduating-interval">Graduating Interval</a></h3>
<p>The delay in days between answering &quot;Good&quot; on a learning card with no steps left,
and seeing the card again as a review card. Please see the example in the
previous section.</p>
<h3 id="easy-interval"><a class="header" href="#easy-interval">Easy Interval</a></h3>
<p>The delay between answering <code>Easy</code> on a learning
card, and seeing it in review mode for the first time.</p>
<p>The <code>Easy</code> button immediately turns a learning card into a review card,
and assigns it the delay you have configured. It should always be at least
as long as the <em>graduating interval</em>, and typically a few days longer.</p>
<h3 id="insertion-order"><a class="header" href="#insertion-order">Insertion Order</a></h3>
<p>Controls whether Anki should add new cards into the deck randomly, or in order.
When you change this option, Anki will re-sort the decks using the current
Option Group.  Cards with a lower due number will be shown first when studying, by
default. Changing this option will automatically update the existing position of
new cards.</p>
<p>One caveat with random order mode: if you review many of your new cards, and then
add more new cards, the newly added material is statistically more likely to
appear than the new cards that were already in the deck. For example, if you have 100 cards
in random order, then review the first 50, newly added cards are still given
position 1-100, but as you have already reviewed the first 50, the newly added
cards are more likely to appear earlier. To correct this, you can change the
order to Ordered mode and back again to force a re-sort.</p>
<p>When you select random order, Anki will randomize your notes, keeping
the cards of a given note close together. The cards of a given note are
shown in the order, in which their card types appear, so that siblings are
introduced consistently — otherwise you could end up in a state where
some notes had all their cards introduced and other notes had only one
or two. Please see the &quot;bury related&quot; and &quot;display order&quot; sections below
for more info.</p>
<h2 id="lapses"><a class="header" href="#lapses">Lapses</a></h2>
<p>When you forget a review card, it is said to have 'lapsed', and the card must be
relearnt. The default behaviour for lapsed reviews is to reset the interval to
1 (i.e. make it due tomorrow), and put it in the learning queue for a refresher
in 10 minutes. This behaviour can be customized with the options listed below.</p>
<h3 id="relearning-steps"><a class="header" href="#relearning-steps">Relearning Steps</a></h3>
<p>The same as 'learning steps', but for forgotten reviews. When you fail a card
(press <code>Again</code>), the card enters the relearning phase, and before it becomes a
review card again, you will have to pass all the relearning steps — or, alternatively, press
<code>Easy</code> on the card.</p>
<p>If you leave the steps blank, the card will skip relearning, and will be assigned
a new review delay.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-interval"><a class="header" href="#minimum-interval">Minimum Interval</a></h3>
<p>Specifies a minimum number of days a card should wait after it finishes relearning.
The default is one day, meaning once relearning is finished, it will be shown again
the next day.</p>
<h3 id="leeches"><a class="header" href="#leeches">Leeches</a></h3>
<p>Control the way Anki handles leeches. Please see the <a href="leeches.html">leeches</a>
section for more information.</p>
<h2 id="timer"><a class="header" href="#timer">Timer</a></h2>
<p>Anki monitors how long it takes you to answer each question, so that it
can show you how long was spent studying each day. The time taken does
not influence scheduling. The default limit is 60 seconds. If you take
longer than that, Anki assumes you have walked away from your computer
or have been distracted, and limits the recorded time to 60 seconds, so
that you don’t end up with inaccurate statistics. If you consistently
take longer than 60 seconds to answer a card, you may want to either
consider raising this limit, or ideally, making your cards simpler.</p>
<h2 id="burying"><a class="header" href="#burying">Burying</a></h2>
<p>Please see <a href="./studying.html#siblings-and-burying">this section</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="display-order"><a class="header" href="#display-order">Display Order</a></h2>
<p>The options in this section are taken from the deck you select to study, not
the deck of the currently displayed card.</p>
<p>This section is only available when you have <a href="https://faqs.ankiweb.net/the-2021-scheduler.html">the v3
scheduler</a> enabled.</p>
<p>Some further information about display order is available in the <a href="studying.html#display-order">studying
section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-card-gather-priority"><a class="header" href="#new-card-gather-priority">New Card Gather Priority</a></h3>
<p>Controls how Anki gathers cards from each subdeck.</p>
<p>With the default <code>Deck</code> ordering, cards are gathered from each subdeck in order,
stopping when the limit of the selected deck has been exceeded. This is faster,
and allows you to priorize subdecks that are closer to the top. Decks / subdecks
are always ordered alphabetically, so you can give them a numeric prefix like
001 to control the order they are shown. You can also use <code>_</code> and <code>~</code> as a
prefix to place items at the top or bottom.</p>
<p>Although position order depends initially on the 'Insertion Order' setting
above, you can manually
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/browsing.html#cards">reposition</a> cards in different
ways.</p>
<h3 id="new-card-sort-order"><a class="header" href="#new-card-sort-order">New Card Sort Order</a></h3>
<p>Controls how cards are sorted <strong>after they have been gathered</strong>.
By default, Anki sorts by template first, to avoid multiple cards of the
same note from being shown in succession. This results in cards appearing
in the order they have been added, with the first card template (eg front-&gt;back)
appearing before later card templates (eg back-&gt;front).</p>
<h3 id="newreview-priority"><a class="header" href="#newreview-priority">New/Review Priority</a></h3>
<p>Whether new cards should be mixed in with reviews, or shown before or after them.</p>
<h3 id="interday-learningreview-priority"><a class="header" href="#interday-learningreview-priority">Interday Learning/Review Priority</a></h3>
<p>Whether learning cards with a 1+ day delay should be mixed in with reviews, or
shown before or after them. Because learning cards tend to be harder than
reviews, some users prefer to see them at the end (getting the easy stuff done
first), or at the start (allowing more time to review forgotten ones).</p>
<h3 id="review-sort-order"><a class="header" href="#review-sort-order">Review Sort Order</a></h3>
<p>The default order prioritizes cards that have been waiting longer, which works
well when you are up to date, or when you only have a small backlog. If you have taken an
extended break or have fallen behind in your reviews, you may want to consider
changing the sort order temporarily. Sorting by ascending intervals will ensure
cards with shorter delays are shown first, and by descending intervals will allow
you to work through the easier material first.</p>
<p>Choosing the <em>Deck, then due date</em> option will ensure reviews are shown for each
subdeck in turn. This is generally not recommended, as having material appear
consistently in the same order makes it easier to guess the answer based on context,
and may lead to weaker memories.</p>
<h2 id="audio"><a class="header" href="#audio">Audio</a></h2>
<p>By default, Anki automatically plays audio on the front and back of
cards. If you uncheck 'automatically play audio', Anki will not play
audio until you press the replay audio key, <code>r</code> or <code>F5</code>.</p>
<p><em>Always include question side when replaying audio</em> controls whether audio from
the question side should be played when replaying the audio while an answer is
shown. Please note that it does not control what happens when you show the
answer; for that please see <a href="templates/fields.html#special-fields">this section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advanced"><a class="header" href="#advanced">Advanced</a></h2>
<h3 id="maximum-interval"><a class="header" href="#maximum-interval">Maximum Interval</a></h3>
<p>Allows you to place an upper limit on the time Anki
will wait to reshow a card. The default is 100 years; you can decrease
this to a smaller number if you’re willing to trade extra study time for
higher retention.</p>
<h3 id="starting-ease"><a class="header" href="#starting-ease">Starting Ease</a></h3>
<p>Controls the easiness that cards start out with. It is
set when a card graduates from learning for the first time. It defaults
to 2.50, meaning that once you have finished learning a card, answering
<code>Good</code> on subsequent reviews will increase the delay by approximately
2.5x (e.g. if the last delay was 10 days, the next delay would be around 25
days). Based upon how you rate the card in subsequent reviews, the
easiness may increase or decrease from its starting value.</p>
<h3 id="easy-bonus"><a class="header" href="#easy-bonus">Easy Bonus</a></h3>
<p>An extra multiplier applied to the interval when a review card is answered
<code>Easy</code>. With the default value of 1.30, <code>Easy</code> will give an interval that is
1.3 times the <code>Good</code> interval (e.g. if the last interval was 10 days, the next 
interval would be around 13 days).</p>
<h3 id="interval-modifier"><a class="header" href="#interval-modifier">Interval Modifier</a></h3>
<p>An extra multiplier that is applied to all reviews. At its default of 1.00 it
does nothing. If you set it to 0.80, though, for example, intervals will be generated at
80% of their normal size (so a 10 day interval would become 8 days). You can
thus use the multiplier to make Anki present cards more or less frequently than
it would otherwise, trading study time for retention or vice versa.</p>
<p>For moderately difficult material, the average user should find they
remember approximately 90% of mature cards that come up for review. You
can find out your own performance by opening the graphs/statistics for a
deck and looking at the Answer Buttons graph - mature retention is the
correct% on the right side of the graph. If you haven’t been studying
long, you may not have any mature cards yet. As performance with new
cards and younger cards can vary considerably, it’s a good idea to wait
until you have a reasonable amount of mature reviews before you start
drawing conclusions about your retention rate.</p>
<p>On the SuperMemo website, they suggest that you can find an appropriate
multiplier for a desired retention rate. Their formula boils down to:</p>
<pre><code>log(desired retention%) / log(current retention%)
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine we have a current retention rate of 85% and we want to increase
it to 90%. We’d calculate the modifier as:</p>
<pre><code>log(90%) / log(85%) = 0.65
</code></pre>
<p>You can use Google to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=log(90%25)+%2F+log(85%25)">calculate
it</a> for you.</p>
<p>If you plug the resulting 65% into the interval modifier, you should
find over time that your retention moves closer to your desired
retention.</p>
<p>One important thing to note however is that the trade-off between time
spent studying and retention is not linear: we can see here that to
increase our retention by 5 percentage points, we would have to study 35%
more frequently. If the material you are learning is very important then
it may be worth the extra effort – that is, of course, something you will need to
decide for yourself. If you are simply worried that you are forgetting too
much, then you may find investing more time at the initial learning stage
and/or using mnemonics will give you more gain for less effort.</p>
<p>One final thing to note is that Anki forces a new interval to be at
least 1 day longer than it was previously, so that you do not get stuck
reviewing with the same interval forever. If your goal is to repeat a
card once a day for multiple days, you can do that by setting more
learning mode steps, instead of by adjusting this modifier.</p>
<h3 id="hard-interval"><a class="header" href="#hard-interval">Hard Interval</a></h3>
<p>The multiplier used when you use the <code>Hard</code> button. The percentage is relative
to the previous interval: e.g. with a default of 1.20, a card with a 10-day interval
will be given 12 days.</p>
<h3 id="new-interval"><a class="header" href="#new-interval">New Interval</a></h3>
<p>The multiplier used when you use the <code>Again</code> button on a review card. The
default 0.00 means that a review card's delay is reset to zero when you forget it
(which then becomes 1 day after the <a href="#minimum-interval">minimum interval</a> is
applied).</p>
<p>If changed from the default, it is possible for forgotten cards to preserve part
of their previous delay. For example, if a card had a 100 day interval, and you set
the <em>New Interval</em> to 0.20, the new interval would be 20 days.</p>
<p>While preserving part of the interval may seem to make sense, SuperMemo has observed
that preserving part of the delay can actually <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Post-lapse_stability">be counter-productive</a>. For this reason, we recommend you leave it on the default setting.</p>
