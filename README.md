# Contributing

Contributions can be made in three ways.

1. **Translating a file.**
    Please see #1 and [conventions](#conventions) below.

2. **Improving an existing translation.**
    A simple PR will do, but please see [conventions](#conventions) below.

3. **Incorporating updates from the official manual.**
    To ensure synchronisation with the official manual, updates to it will be handled
    by the maintainers, until a reasonable workflow has been decided on.
    More extensive updates may be incorporated as-is (in English), and issues opened
    for the new untranslated parts.

## Conventions

### Format

This list of conventions is to ensure easier synchronisation with the official manual,
cleaner merges, and a consistent look.

- Linebreaks, heading placements, etc. in the official manual are to be preserved
  as much as possible.
- File names are not to be translated. Title translations are made in `SUMMARY.md`
  (in square brackets) and have to agree with the titles on the relevant pages.
- Linebreaks should be inserted after (very) roughly 100 characters.
- Formatting, such as `\`` for code and `&lt;kbd&gt;` for key presses, may be
  improved, as it's not consistent in the official manual.

### Translation

This list of conventions is to ensure a minimum of consistency within the manual.
If you disagree with or want to add anything, feel free to open an issue.

- Use "du" over "Sie".
- Anglicisms are to be avoided. (Of course, that's quite often impossible.)
- Translations should sound natural. Don't hesitate to deviate from the original,
  as long as the content remains the same. Updates to the content, however, must be
  made on <https://github.com/ankitects/anki-manual> before they can be integrated
  here.
